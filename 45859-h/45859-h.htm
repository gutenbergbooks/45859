<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">You will often have it said to you, when smarting
under a disappointment, &ldquo;Never mind! it is all for the
best!&rdquo; I dare say you are sometimes inclined to doubt the truth
of this maxim; I remember when I was a child I did, but I have found
out in life, that it does very often prove true. And if you like, I
will tell you one instance in which this was the case.</p>
<p>In the course of one of my rambles in Spain it happened one day that
I was tempted by an old longing to make acquaintance with one of her
most out-of-the-way and primitive villages, to separate from my party
at the comfortable hotel at C&mdash;&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>and make my
way with only one young companion to a place some five miles west,
called Guadaxox, a name which I dare say in your longest geography
lesson you have never been called on to pronounce; and you would find
it no easy matter to do so, unless I wrote it for you thus:
<i>Guadakquoth</i>.</p>
<p>Five miles&rsquo; walk through the clear bright air of Spain, and
the fresh spring breeze charged with all the perfume from the
mountains, is a pleasant prospect enough; and as I can usually adapt
myself to any quarters which may fall to my lot on a march, I had
little fear of not being sufficiently rested to perform the return
journey easily before sunset. My companion was a hearty lad of
fourteen, who had joined us for his Easter vacation from Eton, and the
prospect proposed even less difficulties to him.</p>
<p>I think you would be amused with our little adventures by the way
through a country in which every outline of foreground or horizon,
every tree and plant, every beast or fowl, every implement of
husbandry, every article of dress of the people, every individual thing
you meet, will probably prove new to an English eye. But I must not
dwell on these things now. I will only tell you that we had such a
bright and pleasant day as I have hardly ever known out of Spain; that
we found so much to sketch and so much to interest us altogether, that
we never noticed how the time passed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>nor how the wind from the
mountains had covered the fair sky with angry clouds. It was only when
the first great drops of the storm patted us on the shoulder that we
realized the extent of our difficulty. We looked at the banks of clouds
and then at each other, for we each felt there was little chance of
holding up that evening, and if it did, some of the mountain paths we
had to traverse would be rendered too slippery by the torrent to be
pleasant, not to say safe, for our lowland-bred feet.</p>
<p>It was a <i>contretemps</i> which disconcerted us not a little; but
we turned with what courage remained to see after a shelter for the
night. Time forbids me to describe the only <i>venta</i>, or inn, the
place boasted, it will suffice to say it wanted for <i>every</i>
comfort. It only expected to have hardy peasants to house who would not
object to the earthen floor or the companionship of pigs and fowls in
their slumbers. My Eton companion thought it rather manly to roll
himself up in his great coat and compose himself to sleep on a board
sloped from a low bench on to the floor. For myself I preferred sitting
up, and established myself bravely in a chair, having previously taken
the precaution to replenish the lamp. The first stage of weariness was
just coming on when the door, which there was no means of locking, was
thrown rudely open, and a couple of rough carters were ushered in to
take up their quarters in the same apartment. I remonstrated at the
intrusion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>without success, and something of an altercation
ensued, in the midst of which another door, which I had not before
noticed, was opened by a lady in black, who beckoned me into her room.
I followed her, glad of an escape, but with a misgiving, lest I had not
mended the matter. At first sight I had felt inclined to set her down
as &ldquo;an old hag;&rdquo; but as she talked I saw intelligent
benevolence in her dark eye, and traced remnants of early beauty in her
shrivelled countenance. We were soon friends. She was travelling from
place to place with her daughter, who supported them both by her
exertions on the stage; she had gone on with friends to another village
that evening, so her bed was free; it did not look inviting, and I
excused myself as delicately as I could. She had the tact not to press
the matter; and we continued sitting up, talking about the customs and
legends of the people, a matter in which the old lady was well versed,
and which had always had a special charm for me. She was delighted to
have some one who would listen to her &ldquo;long yarn;&rdquo; and I
was delighted to have found a source at which to satisfy some of my
curiosity about Spanish Traditions.</p>
<p>The next day, as I sat in the hotel at C&mdash;&mdash; writing down
the substance of what she had told me, and which I have embodied in the
following collection of tales, I could not help saying to myself,
&ldquo;Well, it was all for the best. I thought that storm <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>a great
annoyance yesterday, but it has procured me an acquaintance with the
very subjects after which I had had many fruitless researches
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The store thus begun has been added to since in many various ways
which I will not detain you by narrating, as I sincerely hope you are
anxious to plunge into them, and still more that they will answer your
expectations and entertain you as they did me.</p>
<p>I dare say they will seem to you at first very like other stories
you have read, but if you follow them attentively you will trace many
singular national characteristics. One in particular to which I would
call your attention is the spirit of humour of which the Spanish and
particularly the Andalusian people are so fond. This will sometimes
lead them to what we should be inclined to consider irreverence; but it
is nothing of the sort with them; and if you find them speaking with
playfulness on a sacred subject<a class="noteref" id="xd21e732src"
href="#xd21e732" name="xd21e732src">1</a>, it is because such a vein of
faith underlies all they say that the notion of being irreverent never
occurs to them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many tales of Spain are full of memories of
Charlemagne. It is strange that history says comparatively little of
his doings there; but his was a character such as the Spanish Romancers
were sure to seize, and, with their habit of heaping all perfections on
their heroes, ascribe to him all manner of fabulous achievements. Here
is one of the exploits they tell of him:&mdash;</p>
<p>One of the Moorish kings, who sought his alliance in the internecine
turmoils in which the chiefs of their race were at the time engaged,
had an only and beautiful daughter, the apple of his eye, who was
guarded with jealous care, indulged in every wish, waited on by the
most beautiful maidens in a fairy-like palace, and suffered to know
nothing of her father&rsquo;s wars and dangers. Life seemed all
smoothness and pleasure to her; and every one, who at any time met her
eye, made it their delight to obey her faintest sign.</p>
<p>But life passed even amid continual sunshine, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>flowers, and
harmony may become monotonous. When the Moorish princess had had
fifteen years of it, she began to seek some pleasure newer and more
exciting. Her fond father, only glad to hear her express a wish, that
he might have the satisfaction of gratifying it, promised to give her a
fresh diversion such as she had never before seen.</p>
<p>For this purpose he ordered a great <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, and chose out
all the mightiest men of his forces, to perform feats of arms and mock
combats before her.</p>
<p>The princess, who had never witnessed any combat more serious than
that of her pet doves, was delighted beyond measure with the new
sensation, and thought she could never tire of seeing the brave
horsemen contend; dealing each other such heavy blows, and all the
while seeming so indifferent to danger. Nevertheless the time came when
the sameness of these shows struck her too, and she began to crave for
something newer yet.</p>
<p>The king then ordered that valiant men out of other countries should
be invited to come and contend before her, each after the fashion of
their own country; and many warriors of renown were content to come and
display their prowess; the Moslem in the hope of winning the bright
smile of the king&rsquo;s daughter; Christians, to have the opportunity
of displaying their might before the infidel horde.</p>
<p>Among the strangers, but belonging to neither <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>of these
categories, came one day a powerful giant, five cubits high, who rode
on a horse as tall as a house. All the mighty men of the king&rsquo;s
army turned pale when they saw him; and the king regretted that his
invitations to all comers had been so unlimited that he could find no
courteous excuse for excluding him; to prefer an unfair one would have
been dangerous, as his ire would have been terrible if provoked. So he
received him as smilingly as his trepidation would permit; and the
giant seemed a very good-natured person, too full of his own
consequence to think of any thing else, even of picking a quarrel with
any one.</p>
<p>He challenged every one to fight with him, but no one would venture;
and this testimony to his might put him in still better humour. Then he
showed off all his feats of strength, to the great delight of the
court, and of none more than the princess, who was so astonished at the
prodigies he rehearsed, that she leant out from her balcony, and
suffered the veil to blow away from her face.</p>
<p>The giant happened to be looking towards her at the moment, and that
moment sufficed to make him fall in love with her. For the rest of the
day he exhibited his surprising strength with renewed energy; but the
evening was no sooner come, than he stole up to her window, which,
though it was in a very high tower of the <i lang=
"es">alc&aacute;zar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e766src" href=
"#xd21e766" name="xd21e766src">1</a>, was just at a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>convenient
height for his head to reach as he stood upon the ground. Putting his
face against the lattice, he whispered very softly that he must speak
to her. The poor little princess was dreadfully frightened, and could
not guess what he wanted, but thought it would not be dignified to show
any fear; so she went near enough to the window to be heard by him, and
asked him his pleasure. The giant told her that he loved her, and she
must marry him. The princess was dreadfully terrified when she heard
this, for she knew she had no possible means of resisting him if he
chose to carry her off by force; and she reflected, too, that her
father himself would have very little chance if he attempted to fight
him: and what a dreadful thing it would be if he should kill her
father&mdash;her dear father, who was so fond of her! Yet in the fright
she was in, she could think of no better stratagem than to stammer
forth that he must give her time to think about it.</p>
<p>The giant was not very dissatisfied with this reply, and promised he
would leave her quite to herself till the next day. All that night, and
all the next day, the little princess thought and thought of what
excuse she could make; but she could think of nothing but to ask him to
give her another day; and then again she sat and thought, and no
invention would come: and she durst not tell, her father, lest he
should in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>indignation challenge the giant to fight, and be
killed by him. But when he came the third time, and she could still
think of no stratagem for getting rid of him, she was obliged to tell
him plainly that she could not make up her mind to marry him.</p>
<p>At first the giant tried all sorts of clumsy persuasions and
entreaties; but the maiden held firm; and at last, finding she would
not yield, he grew fiercely angry, seized the alc&aacute;zar by the
roof, and made it rock backwards and forwards, tore up the trees, and
threw them on the ground, and stamped upon the soil with a noise like
peals of thunder. The poor little princess was so terrified she hardly
knew what was happening, only she heard him swear that he would come
back and take her by a way she could not escape him; and after
repeating that threat several times at length disappeared.</p>
<p>It was a long time before the princess came to her senses again, for
she had fainted with the dire terror, and when she did, she began to
wonder what the terrible trouble was which had so shattered her; by
degrees the memory of the stormy scenes lately passed came back to her,
but all was now so calm and still, she could hardly realize the truth
of what she had gone through. It was a great relief to find the giant
was quite gone&mdash;far away; and she learnt that he lived a long,
long way off, in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11"
name="pb11">11</a>]</span>valley as far below the level of the plain as
the height on which her father&rsquo;s alc&aacute;zar stood was above
it. She remembered, indeed, his threat that he would come back, but it
seemed that it would have been so easy for him to have taken her then
had he been so minded, that she could not think he was serious in the
intention to carry her off at all. Why should he come back to do what
he might just as well have done at once?</p>
<p>Time passed on, and she heard no more of the giant; people left off
talking of his feats of strength, and she began to forget all about
him. A matter happened, too, which gave another direction to her
thoughts. A neighbouring king made war upon her father, and with such
overwhelming preparations, that this time he could not conceal the fact
from her. Every one was full of apprehensions, and the king, distracted
with the fear of losing his kingdom, had no time even to think of the
fancies of his beloved daughter. The princess heard from one and
another of the attendants that things were going very wrong, that the
enemy were getting the upper hand, and advancing nearer and nearer; but
she learnt more from their anxious looks than from their lips, for
every one was afraid to distress her by giving her details of the
truth.</p>
<p>We must now go back to the giant, whom we left marching off in no
good humour. The truth about him was, that with all his strength he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>not very courageous&mdash;he was more of a bully
than a warrior. He had heard a great deal of the bravery and more
particularly of the excellent arms of the Moors, and as he knew they
would rise as one man to defend their princess if he carried her off,
he did not like the idea of their making pincushions of his legs with
their fine sharp swords, even if they could not reach to do him further
damage. So he resolved to carry out his plan in a way which would be
less fraught with danger to himself.</p>
<p>Coming down from the alc&aacute;zar, he went on to the neighbouring
sovereign, and treacherously gave him a description of all he had seen
at the court where he had just been staying; told him the number and
situation of the army, and the condition of the defences, and pointed
out the least protected points of the country by which an incursion
could be made. Having received a rich guerdon for this information, he
continued his way homewards, and then set all his people to work to cut
a long cave, which he made them extend further and further in a sloping
direction till it should come out opposite the alc&aacute;zar where the
Moorish princess dwelt, by means of which he could reach her
unperceived, and carry her off without danger to his own skin, while
the city was in the midst of the tumult which he thought would be
brought about by the inroad of the inimical power he had perfidiously
invoked. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>Various underground rumblings had been observed for some time past
by the country people, but as they held little communication with each
other it did not strike them that the sounds continually advanced in
the direction of the capital. Indeed, all minds were too much filled
with apprehensions of the destruction the advancing foe above ground
was likely to reek upon their property, to have time to give way to
fears of a chimerical foe in the regions below the soil.</p>
<p>Thus the giant worked on steadily and without hindrance, while the
poor little princess was far from thinking of her tormentor otherwise
than as at a safe distance; much less did she dream of his continually
nearing approach! Enough she had to excite her anxiety without this.
And she sat crying over her father&rsquo;s danger till her face became
quite pale and her eyes worn with tears.</p>
<p>At last a day came when every one seemed bright with fresh hope; and
they ran hastily enough to tell her the good news. The youthful
conqueror, Carlo Magno, had been appealed to by the king to help him.
His advent had entirely turned the tide of affairs: the enemy had been
completely repulsed, and the victorious army was returning in triumph
to the city.</p>
<p>The news spread like wildfire; every one hasted to deck their houses
festively, and put on their best attire, to do honour to the
conquerors; and when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14"
name="pb14">14</a>]</span>they appeared, shouted their thanks in loud
acclamations. The little princess was very desirous to see the young
hero who had saved her father&rsquo;s life; and, though it is not the
custom for Moorish women to appear in public, she contrived to see him
as he passed by, and thought in the silence of her heart how nice it
would have been if it had been the handsome Christian who had wanted to
marry her instead of the monstrous giant. Having once seen him, she was
so desirous to see him again that she sent to ask him to come, that she
might thank him for having saved her father&rsquo;s kingdom; but it was
not entirely for her father&rsquo;s sake that she contrived the
interview.</p>
<p>When he came, however, though he was very courteous towards her, he
was also very reserved, and stayed a very short time; assured her that
what he had done was nothing at all; that his sword was ever ready to
defend the right, whoever it might be invoked his aid; and with that
took his leave without paying her any compliments. The Moorish princess
was sad when she saw him go out so; and sadder still when she learnt
that no Christian prince cared to know a Moorish maid. Carlo Magno
himself, however, was sorry for the poor child, as he had seen that she
wanted to be better acquainted with him; but he could hold no intimacy
with the unbeliever.</p>
<p>The giant, meantime, had gone on boring away; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>and,
though he had now got quite under the alc&aacute;zar, every one was so
full of festivity and rejoicing that nobody heeded the sound of his
pickaxe. On his part, he had not been altogether unmindful to listen
for the sounds which might keep him informed of what was going on in
the upper world, he had been very well satisfied with what he heard.
There had been unmistakable clashings of battle, and he never doubted
that the princess&rsquo;s father must be getting the worst of it; and
now, when he heard the sounds of busy running to and fro in the festive
palace, he made sure it was his allies pillaging the place.</p>
<p>At last the tunnel was complete; he crept out in the first fall of
the darkness of night, threaded the familiar way up to the
princess&rsquo;s window, rested his foot on the cornice of the first
story for a stepping-stone, and with one grasp of his hand had swept
her off her couch before she had time to open her eyes. Then closing
her mouth, so that she might not cry and raise an alarm, walked quietly
back with her to his subterranean passage, down the sloping path of
which he carried her in exultation.</p>
<p>Quickly and silently as the feat had been performed, the keen bright
eyes of a little black slave had followed the whole affair, as she lay
at the foot of her mistress&rsquo;s couch. She had seen the huge hand
spread over the room,&mdash;the nail of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>little
finger had indeed sadly grazed her forehead. She recognized it at once
as belonging to the giant, her mistress&rsquo;s dread of whom she had
so often shared. And no sooner was her helplessness to rescue her
apparent, than she rushed madly into the banqueting-hall, tearing her
clothes and plucking out her hair, and crying out in wailing accents
what had befallen. It was not easy to gain credence to so strange a
story; and when at last her earnestness induced belief in her
sincerity, the princess&rsquo;s room had to be searched to afford the
necessary proof that she was gone. When this was found to be indeed but
too true, the wail was taken up by all the people. The banquet was
broken up, and every one went hither and thither, not knowing what to
do; for, withal that the giant was so big, none had seen him pass to
tell which way he had gone.</p>
<p>But Carlo Magno, brave and self-possessed in the midst of all, saw
an occasion to be of service to the poor Moorish princess, and make up
for the disappointment he had caused her in the morning. It was plain
to him that if the giant had stood under the window, as the little
black slave had said, he must have left his foot-prints there; and that
he could thence be tracked whithersoever he had gone. So he raised a
loud voice, and bid all the people be still: and that if they would all
remain without stirring, he would deliver their princess; for he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>wanted them not to stir up the soil any more, lest
they should destroy the track.</p>
<p>The voice of Carlo Magno, after what he had already done for them,
possessed great authority with the people; and so all stood quite
still, while he bade the little black slave guide him to the window;
and there, under it, sure enough he found the giant&rsquo;s footprints,
two great holes in the sand, like dry tanks for water. Allowing due
space for his prodigious stride, the prince readily found another and
another, till they brought him to the mouth of the tunnel, where he had
indeed passed. When all the people saw the great gaping hole which had
never appeared there before that night, and gazed down its descending
gullet, no wonder they thought it was the mouth of hell opened to vomit
forth its monster.</p>
<p>But Carlo Magno said he would deliver the princess though his
enterprise should indeed lead him into the realms of Hades. And all the
people applauded his courage, but he went down the black path
alone.</p>
<p>Though he travelled at all speed, the giant had now good start, and
the length of his step was equal to several of the Christian
prince&rsquo;s charger; but Carlo Magno made such good haste that he
had not got above a hundred miles before he heard the giant&rsquo;s
laugh, exulting over his prize, resounding through the gloomy passage,
though still at some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18"
name="pb18">18</a>]</span>considerable distance. This roused the
Christian prince&rsquo;s indignation, and made him urge his steed yet
faster, till at last he came within sight of him. And then, when he saw
his monstrous arms bearing the little helpless princess, his compassion
made him use yet greater speed, till at length just as he reached the
mouth of the cave, Carlo Magno managed to overstep him by one bound of
his horse, and then wheeling round confronted him with fearless
eye.</p>
<p>The giant I have already said was more of a bully than a warrior.
When he saw the Christian knight so brave and firm, and withal encased
in such strong armour, and brandishing his trenchant sword, he felt his
best defence lay in hectoring and boasting, and thereby frightening the
Christian hero from attempting to fight him.</p>
<p>With a terrible voice, therefore, which made the rocks resound, he
asked his opponent, on whom he lavished every startling epithet, what
he meant by venturing to appear before him; following up the question
by such a volley of imprecations and threats as he fancied would
suffice to make him wish to escape with a whole skin.</p>
<p>Carlo Magno, however, who knew that the dogs who bark most bite
least, waited unmoved till he had exhausted his whole repertory of
violent language, and then quite undismayed summoned him to surrender
the maiden. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another loud and angry volley followed upon this demand, with
further threats of the terrible vengeance he intended to take on the
intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Carlo Magno, &ldquo;if you will not give
her up quietly, I must even take her by force.&rdquo; And with that he
dismounted and drew his sword. The giant saw now that he must defend
his life, or he would lose it; and so, forced to fight, he drew his
clumsy sword and began laying about him in right-determined fashion;
but all his blows alighted far and wide of the Christian prince.
Furious at finding his awkward efforts ineffectual, while the highly
trained agility of the prince saved him from all his strokes, he began
laying about him with such untempered violence that at last his weapon
dropped from his hand. Fully expecting that Carlo Magno would try to
possess himself of it, he hastily bent down to regain it. But Carlo
Magno had other thoughts. Waiting calmly till the monster had bent him
sufficiently low, he swung his fine sharp blade and buried it deep in
his heart with the unerring dexterity with which the matador lays low
his bull&mdash;at one thrust.</p>
<p>Of course he severed the giant&rsquo;s head afterwards to bear away
as his trophy; and raising the princess in his arms, who had swooned
away at sight of the horrid combat, bore her swiftly upwards through
the subterranean path and delivered her, yet unconscious, to her
father. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A great war was proclaimed between Spain and Portugal,
and the king called all his knights to arms to follow him into the
field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Conde,&rdquo; said the wife of Conde Sol, &ldquo;how
many years will you be absent in this campaign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am not back, Condesa, in six years, reckon me dead, and
forget me, and take another husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six years pass, and eight, and ten, and one more yet, and the Conde
Sol is not come back, nor has any news been heard of him. Men say he
has fallen in the wars; but the Countess believes them not; her heart
tells her that her husband lives, and she will take no rest and no
diversion. Her father comes to see her, and he finds her always in
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails thee, daughter dear? Why are thy eyes ever filled
with tears?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, let me go to seek the Count; for my heart tells me he
lives, and that I shall find him.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p><span class="corr" id="xd21e858" title=

blessing go with thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the Countess sets out and goes to seek the Count,
bowed down with sadness, by land and by sea, through all Spain and
Italy and France. One day she comes to a vast plain shaded by
pine-trees, and in the shade a herd of kine grazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, I pray you, <i lang="es">vaquerita</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e867src" href="#xd21e867" name="xd21e867src">1</a>,
and tell me now in truth, whose are the kine grazing in these
pastures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to the Conde Sol, lady, who commands all this
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all these wheat crops that they are just garnering in,
<i lang="es">vaquerita</i>; tell me in truth, whose are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Conde Sol&rsquo;s, lady; for it is he sows these
fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whose are all those sheep, <i lang="es">vaquerita</i>,
all with their little lambs gathered round them so tenderly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Conde Sol&rsquo;s, lady; for it is he who has them
bred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whose these gardens and this royal-seeming palace,
<i lang="es">vaquerita</i>? Tell me the truth, I pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also the Conde Sol&rsquo;s, lady; for it is there he has his
abode.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=

<p>&ldquo;And whose are those horses, <i lang="es">vaquerita</i>, which
I hear neighing in the stall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They belong to the Conde Sol, lady; for he goes with them to
the hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whose is that fair dame, <i lang="es">vaquerita</i>, who
stands so near that knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the affianced of the Conde Sol, lady, whom he is just
going to make his bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i lang="es">vaquerita, vaquerita</i>, by the love of
our Lord&rsquo;s sufferings, give me here thy poor dress, and take my
robe of silk, and let me go, for I have found him I seek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she put on the poor dress, and went and stood where the Count
must pass, begging charity. When the Count came by, he bent down over
his saddle-bow, and gave her an alms, and asked her,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good stranger woman, whence are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Spain was I born,&rdquo; answered the Countess, with a
faltering voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why do you come hither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go over all countries seeking my long lost husband, and so
by chance I came here too. I have gone through perils on the sea, and
hardships on the land; my feet are cut by the stony rocks;
and&mdash;will you believe me, Conde?&mdash;when at last I find him I
learn that he is about <i>to be married</i>, Conde; that he had so
forgotten his fond and lawful spouse who had come so far for love of
him!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=

<p>&ldquo;Neither has the evil one sent me, Conde, neither do I seek to
tempt thee; but nevertheless I am thy true wife, Conde, who has come so
far to seek thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Conde Sol, when he heard that, sent to fetch a light-footed
palfrey wearing a breast-band covered with silver bells, and with
stirrups and spurs of gold; and on to this he sprang, and rode back to
the castle bearing his good wife in his arms, and presenting her to all
his people, bade them honour her as their lawful mistress. <span class=

<h2 class="main">SIMPLE JOHNNY AND THE SPELL-BOUND PRINCESSES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Ferdinand King of Spain drove the Moors out of
his dominions with his invincible sword, there were among their chiefs
many descended from right noble lineage. Among them was one, of whose
ancestor Clotaldo the following story was told, who for his prowess was
elected king of the fertile provinces of that part of the East which is
called Syria.</p>
<p>Clotaldo had three beautiful daughters, who were so beautiful that
men said they were divinities and not women. The King thought that as
they were so very beautiful they ought not to be given in marriage in
the ordinary way, but that whoso would marry them should perform some
great deed of valour. So he called together all the masons of the
kingdom and made them build an immense castle, so high that it seemed
to reach up to heaven. And more than this, he gathered all the
magicians and made them enchant it with all their enchantments,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>so that no one might ever be able to get at them
or see them unless the King himself should admit him.</p>
<p>So the magicians enchanted the castle with all their spells, and set
three enchanted horses to guard the enclosure so that no one might
break through.</p>
<p>Meantime the King sent heralds round into all countries to proclaim
that every noble, or knight of high degree, who could make his way into
the castle should have one of his daughters in marriage; they were
likewise at the same time to set forth their beauty, to let all men
know the worth of the prize for which they were asked to contend. And
he did this because he thought that none but one worthy of them would
be able to overcome all the obstacles he had interposed.</p>
<p>Many were the adventurous and valorous knights and nobles and
princes who were drawn to try their fortune at this high enterprise.
But none could find any way into the castle, and they all came back
crest-fallen, without having effected any thing.</p>
<p>At last came three brothers, who though but simple knights and poor
of estate, yet were of high and noble lineage, and of higher and nobler
courage. They no sooner heard Clotaldo&rsquo;s heralds pronounce this
embassy in their country, which was Denmark, than they set out to try
whether they might not be fortunate enough to deliver the three
princesses from the enchanted tower. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>First they came to Clotaldo and told him their purpose, who ordered
that every thing they asked for should be given them for their
assistance; so the two elder brothers asked for mettled horses and
shining arms; but the youngest brother said all he wanted was a waggon
and two oxen, with provisions for several days, an immeasurably long
rope, some long nails, and a powerful hammer. Whatever each asked for
he received.</p>
<p>The two elder brothers set off very confidently on their dashing
steeds, and in a very short time arrived at an eminence overlooking the
castle; but to their dismay they found it was ten times as high as they
had ever imagined; and then, too, that it had neither door nor window,
nor the smallest break of any kind in the massive walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we ever get into a place like this?&rdquo; said the
eldest brother, looking very foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me very like a fool&rsquo;s errand,&rdquo; said
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote we go back,&rdquo; answered the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing we can do,&rdquo; rejoined the second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sooner the better,&rdquo; continued the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we go, then,&rdquo; added the second; and they turned
their horses&rsquo; heads round, like chicken-hearted men, and galloped
back by the way they had come. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>They had not gone far when they met their younger brother toiling
along in his cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no use your going to the castle,&rdquo; said the eldest
brother: &ldquo;we have been there, and find the game is
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; answered the youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you the thing can&rsquo;t be done!&rdquo;
ejaculated the second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I go out to do a thing I don&rsquo;t go back without
doing it,&rdquo; said the youngest, quietly. &ldquo;But as there is a
considerable distance to be got over yet, I am going to have some
dinner: you had better do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other brothers, who had not had the foresight to bring any
provisions themselves, were very glad of the invitation, so they all
sat down and dined. When they had done, the youngest brother set out to
continue his journey in his waggon, and the two horsemen were going to
pursue theirs homewards, when suddenly one of them said to the other,
&ldquo;Suppose we stop and see what he does; may-be he will succeed,
and then, as we are two to one, who knows but that we may be able to
overcome him, and take the merit to ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well thought!&rdquo; exclaimed the eldest, heartily; and they
turned their horses&rsquo; heads again, and followed behind the cart;
telling their younger brother they had come to see if they could not be
of any service in case his temerity led him into danger. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>The younger had overheard their conversation; but he saw no way of
getting rid of the brothers, who were well armed and well mounted; so
he could but continue his way and trust to his wits to save him from
their intentions afterwards. As he rode along he measured the vast
height of the castle with his eye, and laid all his plans in his head.
Arrived under the wall, he bound the nails and hammer into his girdle,
and, tying one end of the rope round his arm, proceeded to scale the
wall of the castle.</p>
<p>The brothers sat on their horses watching him, expecting every
minute to see him fall to the ground; but on he went, steady and lithe,
with the tenacity of a cat or squirrel, till he got so high that he
looked like a little speck, and at last was lost from sight
altogether.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he attained the battlements of the wall, and trod a few
steps upon the flat, than three most beautiful nymphs, who seemed more
divine than human, came out to meet him. At first he was so dazzled
with the sight of their exceeding beauty, that he could not speak, but
stood gazing at them while they said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou, young man, who venturest to profane the decorum
of this <i lang="es">alc&aacute;zar</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1003src" href="#xd21e1003" name="xd21e1003src">1</a>, the abode
of three virgin princesses? With thy life must thou expiate this
temerity.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;To die at your command, fair ladies, and in your sight, would
be joy enough for me,&rdquo; stammered forth the young knight;
&ldquo;but yet I have first a work to accomplish, which is your
liberation. So tell me now, what is it I have to do to set you
free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since thou art so stout-hearted and so well-spoken,&rdquo;
responded the sisters, &ldquo;we will even tell thee what thou hast to
do, and great shall be thy reward. Know, then, in this castle are three
noble horses, and thou hast to take one hair from the tail of each, for
in this lies the spell which binds us. But they are fierce and shy of
approach; nevertheless fear not if they even breathe out fire upon
thee; for if thou art bold, thou shalt succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young knight went out to meet the three enchanted horses without
fearing or flinching; and though they breathed out fire upon him, he
took the three hairs from their tails, and destroyed the spell of the
princesses.</p>
<p>Then he bound the cord round the first princess, and with much care
and address he lowered her gently and safely on to the ground below. He
did the same with the second. But when he would have parted from the
third, she turned and thanked him with gentle words, and
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this necklace, noble youth, which for both workmanship
and power has no other like to it on earth. Never part from it, and
may-be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>that one day it may deliver thee from as great
strait as that from which thou hast delivered us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she waved her hand to him, and prepared to descend as her
sisters had done.</p>
<p>As soon as the young knight had watched her reach the ground in
safety, he turned to drive the strong nails into the tower to make fast
the rope for his own descent; but scarcely was he thus occupied than
his wicked brothers, seeing the moment of their advantage had arrived,
gave a violent pull to the rope, and down it came, leaving him no means
of escape!</p>
<p>Then they made haste and carried off the princesses, riding on
without stopping till they came to the king.</p>
<p>Clotaldo, seeing his daughters free, never doubted but that those
who had brought them were their true deliverers, and therefore loaded
them with honour and favour, and married them to the two elder
princesses. It was in vain that the youngest princess tried to explain
the deceit: there were four living witnesses against her; for the elder
princesses took the part of their promised husbands, and said that the
long imprisonment had turned their younger sister&rsquo;s mind, and no
one listened to her. So there was a great rejoicing, and a noble
marriage-feast; but she sat in her chamber apart, weeping.</p>
<p>Meantime the youngest brother was left full of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>terror
and dismay on top of the exceeding high tower, with no means of ever
getting away from it, and, which was worst of all, with the prospect of
never again seeing his little princess. He did not care about the
others, but she who alone had thanked him, and that so prettily, and
who had had a thought for his future welfare in giving him the splendid
necklace, he could not give <i>her</i> up.</p>
<p>He took it out and looked at it: it was indeed of curious
workmanship, and the bright gems sparkled like rays of hope. He kissed
it because it reminded him of the kind little princess, but he could
not see how it was to help him; so after gazing at it for a long time,
he at last wrapped it up, and put it by in his bosom again. But as he
continued to think of all that had lately taken place, he remembered
how the sisters had spoken of the wonderful qualities of the horses who
held their spell, and at last he began to wonder whether with their aid
he could not make his escape.</p>
<p>To remain where he was was certain death, and a shameful,
pusillanimous death to boot. He was never wanting in clear thoughts, or
fair courage to execute them, and a plan now ripened rapidly in his
mind which he determined to put into execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou art bold, thou shalt succeed.&rdquo; The words rang
in his ears, and seemed an omen of good fortune. He went back to the
place where he had found the horses before: there they stood,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>all three abreast of each other, as if waiting a
word of command from him.</p>
<p>Resolutely the young knight sprang on the back of the centre one,
and gathering the floating manes of the three in his hand, all started
together, and with one fearful bound, which seemed to shiver the tower
to atoms behind them, they dashed off the battlements, the wild career
through the air depriving him of the use of his senses.</p>
<p>When he came to, he found himself lying on the ground in a wild wood
so full of thick trunks of withered trees that daylight hardly
penetrated. He walked on for a long lonesome way, till at last he came
to a place where cattle were feeding. Of the herd tending them he asked
where he was, and found he was on the borders of Clotaldo&rsquo;s
kingdom; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; said the herd, &ldquo;you are not of this
people, by your dress and speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, friend,&rdquo; replied the young knight; &ldquo;I am a
poor foreigner, who am come out to seek fortune, and she has reduced me
to a sad plight. But I have one favour to ask, which is that you will
exchange clothes with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cattle-herd was pleased enough at the proposal, and asked no
further questions. He had soon arrayed himself in the knight&rsquo;s
fine clothes, and he in turn found a complete disguise in the rough
clothing of undressed skins which made up the peasant&rsquo;s attire.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus he walked on eight hundred leagues, begging alms to sustain his
life by the way; and with all the fatigues, and privations, and
hardships he had endured, he was quite altered, so that his brothers
would not know him again. That he might appear still more different
from his former self, he assumed the manners of a half-silly person,
and took the name of Juan; and all the people called him
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Juanillo el loco</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1056src" href="#xd21e1056" name="xd21e1056src">2</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time Clotaldo had been urging his youngest daughter that
she should marry like her sisters, but she never would look at any of
the princes he named to her. She had determined to belong to no one but
the young knight her deliverer, and she felt all confidence in his
valour, that he would find means to make his way to her. At last, one
day, when the king had been persuading her very urgently to follow his
counsel, she brought out a drawing she had made in secret of the
necklace she had bestowed on her knight, and told her father that when
he could find any one who could produce a necklace like that, she would
be his wife.</p>
<p>The king was very glad to have her consent on any conditions, and
forthwith set clever draughtsmen to copy the drawing, and sent heralds
abroad over the whole earth, to proclaim that whoever could make the
necklet to the required pattern <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34"
href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>should have the hand of his
daughter. But the workmanship was so fine, and the setting of the
jewels so cunningly devised, that no goldsmith on earth could produce
it.</p>
<p>It was just about the time that Juan reached the kingdom that all
the people were full of excitement about this subject, and thus it came
to his ears also. So when he heard the conditions the princess had
made, and remembered her words when she gave him the
necklet&mdash;&ldquo;that the earth could not produce such
another&rdquo;&mdash;he was beside himself for joy, for he knew that
she was waiting for his return.</p>
<p>However, not to betray himself too soon, he continued his silly
ways, and, as if he knew nothing of the matter, asked to see the
design. The guards and people told him to go away, but the king was a
very just man, and said there was no exception named in his decree, and
therefore whoever applied must be allowed a fair trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, when he saw the rough, uncouth form of
the suppliant, &ldquo;remember, fellow, if you fail, your throat shall
pay the forfeit of your impudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The feigned Juanillo played his part perfectly; he gave his assent
by a silly grin, and a nod of his head to all the remonstrances used to
dissuade him; and at last they shut him up in a tower, with a furnace
and crucible, and much gold, and priceless diamonds, and emeralds, and
rubies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the knight let them fasten the gate as if he were going to set to
work in earnest. And at the end of three days, when they came to see
what he had done, he brought out the original necklet; and every one
was in amazement, because all could see that it presented the perfect
image of the design.</p>
<p>When the princess heard by the cries of all the people that some one
had succeeded in producing the necklet, she came forward to see who it
was; and in an instant, through all the disguise, she knew her
deliverer again; and she turning to the king said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the conditions are fulfilled: I am ready to do your
bidding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father was amazed at her readiness to marry the rough, silly man
Juanillo appeared, and tried all he could to dissuade her; but, as she
would not change her mind, there was no excuse for him to go back from
the word plighted by his proclamation. So the princess and the knight
were married; though Clotaldo was so ashamed of the bridegroom, he had
the ceremony performed in the quietest way, and assigned them a little
house outside the walls of the town to live in, where no one should see
or hear any thing more of them.</p>
<p>Clotaldo had had a very prosperous career hitherto; but the troubles
of life were beginning to press round him, and the first trouble he had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>was failing eyesight. His physicians could not
understand the malady, or do any thing for him; and at last he became
quite blind. In despair at the loss of his sight, he sent into all
countries to call together the wisest mediciners; but none could help
him; till one day an ancient man appeared, who said that the only
remedy for his case was the water of a fountain flowing out of a sharp
rock in the mountains of Sclavonia; but that it was a perilous journey
to fetch it, on account of the fierce beasts inhabiting the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>As there was no one with sufficient courage to run the great risks,
the king called his two sons-in-law, and said, as they had been so
valiant in overcoming the spells of the great castle, they could
doubtless help him now; and that they would not shrink from the perils
of the journey, which was to procure the means of restoring his
sight.</p>
<p>The knights did not dare to show any hesitation, as it would have
betrayed their former deception. So they set out on the journey, but
with heavy hearts, and plotting as they went what excuse they could
make for coming back without success.</p>
<p>But Juanillo, the moment he had heard the old physician&rsquo;s
sentence, had taken counsel with his princess, and at her bidding went
out into the wilderness, and called one of the enchanted horses, and
vaulting on to him, sped away like a whirlwind. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>After
passing through ten thousand perils, he filled his flask with the water
of the fountain which sprang out of the sharp rock in the mountains of
Sclavonia, and made the best of his way back again.</p>
<p>As he had nearly reached home he met his two brothers riding out,
looking very doleful and in great perplexity. When they saw him
speeding along like the wind, they were very curious to know who he was
and whence he came; so they called to him to stop and tell them. And he
answered, courteously,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to fill my flask with water which flows over the
sharp rock in the mountains of Sclavonia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they heard that, their first impulse was to spring upon him and
take the prize from him; but when they saw his impetuous horse, and
reflected that he had come back unscathed from all the perils of the
adventure, they perceived who he was, and feared to measure their
strength against his, therefore they assumed a different tone. Instead,
however, of making up for past faults, and cheerfully acquiescing and
rejoicing in his success, they still followed their selfish aim, but in
a more covert way than they had at first meditated. Thus they offered
him any bribe he liked to name if he would give them the flask of
water.</p>
<p>Juanillo gave them the flask, but refused their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>bribes,
naming as his only guerdon two golden pears which the king had given
them off a tree in his garden, which only produced two every year, and
which none might pluck but he.</p>
<p>The bargain was thus settled. Juanillo returned to tell all to the
little princess; and the two knights bore the flask exulting to the
king, and vaunting the deeds of valour by which they pretended they had
won it, taking care to say nothing about poor Juanillo.</p>
<p>The king recovered his sight, and loaded them with rewards and
honours. But before long he was stricken with another infirmity:
gradually his hearing began to fail; and getting no relief from his
physicians, he very soon became quite deaf. A proclamation of great
reward attracted the learned in the medical art again to his court, and
among the men of science came once more the old doctor who had given
effectual counsel before.</p>
<p>In the deserts of Albania, he said, under the shade of the highest
mountains, live, among their many wild beasts, a race of lionesses,
more fierce than the rest of their kind: if any one can by artifice
procure the milk of one of these, without injury to her life, that
would be the sovereign remedy.</p>
<p>Juanillo no sooner heard the sentence than he went out into the
wilderness and called another of the enchanted horses, and started off
on him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>like the wind, to the desert of Albania; and,
armed with the words of magic the little princess had taught him, he
could get up to the lioness without being perceived by her, and fill
his flask with her milk.</p>
<p>Meantime the king had called his two elder sons-in-law, and not
doubting that, as they had acquitted themselves so well before, they
would be able to accomplish this feat also, despatched them to the
mountains of Albania. They, suspecting that their brother would do the
work as before, set out with less concern than on former occasions, and
only plotted how they should cajole him this time. Nor had they
advanced many leagues when they met him coming back at full speed on
his brave steed, and the bottle of lioness&rsquo; milk in a flask at
his girdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morrow, friend!&rdquo; they cried, as he came near:
&ldquo;whence ride ye, so fast and so early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to the desert of Albania, to fetch the
lioness&rsquo; milk to bathe the ears of our good king,&rdquo; replied
the younger brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what price do ye put it, friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, this I sell <i>not</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have come out to fetch it, and how shall we return to
the king without it?&rdquo; And they pleaded so wheedlingly, that
Juanillo was fain to give them the flask, but exacting this time the
penalty of an ear of each of them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40"
href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>The condition was hard, but the game was desperate now. If they
returned empty-handed this time, it was an acknowledgment of their
perfidy before; and after all it was a much less injury than might have
befallen them in the deserts of Albania if they had pursued the
journey, or from the anger of the king and the populace if they had
remained at home. So they combed the hair over their ears to conceal
the loss, and pushed their way home to the king with their trophy,
while Juanillo returned to his little princess.</p>
<p>Clotaldo recovered his hearing by the use of the lioness&rsquo;
milk. But a direr danger awaited him now; for a powerful neighbouring
sovereign suddenly declared war against him, while he was quite
unprepared. His prowess in battle in his younger days it was which had
procured him the throne; but now, in his declining years, he feared to
take the field, not through any coward fear for his life, but lest the
glory of his country should be tarnished by his waning energy. So he
called his two sons-in-law to him, and said that their valour, which
had been proved in so many enterprises, had now a signal occasion for
manifesting itself; and he gave them the command of Captains-General of
his forces, and sent them out as if they had been his own sons, to meet
the foe.</p>
<p>This order gave them greater trepidation than any of the preceding,
for there appeared no way out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>of it. How was Juanillo himself to
fight the battle for them without an army? and how could they transfer
the command of the army to him without betraying all?</p>
<p>While they were going along, then, sad of heart, to put themselves
at the head of the forces and trust to good luck to extricate them from
the fray, they met Juanillo, coming along at fiery speed, with two of
the enemy&rsquo;s standards planted on his stirrups, and they saw by
the colours that the enemy had been laid low. For at the first threat
of war he had taken soft leave of the little princess, had gone out
into the wilderness and called the third of the enchanted horses, and
with him had ridden with such impetuosity against the enemy, imitating
Saint Jago, that he had put the whole army to flight, and borne off
their banners as trophies.</p>
<p>But the brothers talked and persuaded him, with soft words, into
giving these up also; and the payment he exacted this time was, that
they should let him brand them on the shoulder as if they had been his
slaves of war.</p>
<p>After this he returned home to the little princess, and his brothers
carried the banners to the king&rsquo;s feet. When the king saw this
fresh testimony to their merit, his indignation rose high against his
third son-in-law, whom he supposed to be living in shameful indolence,
and doing nothing for the honour <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>of the dynasty and nation. So he
pronounced a decree banishing him from his kingdom, and forbidding him
ever to appear before him again. The brothers, who had always lived in
fear that their treachery would come out some day, upheld him in his
intention, as they thought they would breathe easier when he was
removed to a distance.</p>
<p>Now Juanillo had been very forbearing and very generous all this
time, but this was rather too much. He could not bear that his little
princess should be banished from her friends and country without any
fault; and she, too, represented to him how sad it would be for the
people when the old king died, if they were to live under the
governance of the two wicked brothers. So Juanillo went up to the king,
and begged him with great humility on his knees that he would grant him
one last favour before he went away for good and all; and that was, to
have a famous banquet on the last day, and invite all the kingdom to
it.</p>
<p>The good king granted the request; and a day was appointed when all
the great men and small of the kingdom met for a famous banquet.</p>
<p>Simple Johnny dressed himself for this occasion in his true
character. His massive chestnut curls were parted on his lofty
forehead, and every one was struck by the dignity with which his broad
shoulders carried the crimson and ermine mantle; in fact, few suspected
that it was Simple Johnny at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>all, and the most inclined to believe
it were still doubtful. But he, as one who had a great duty to perform,
went up with earnest mien to the king, and laying down the two pears
and the ears before him said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time is come, O King, to make known the truth to thee.
Long have I suffered in secret; but if my silence is to occasion my
banishment and that of my dear wife, I must make known that it was I
who delivered the princesses, I who fetched the water from the sharp
rock in the mountains of Sclavonia, I who brought the milk of the
lioness from the deserts of Albania, I who overcame thine enemies and
brought home the two standards. Here are my proofs; and if more are
needed, bid the princes uncover their shoulders, and they shall be
found branded as my slaves taken in war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good king was much astonished at this revelation; but now
something came back to him of what the little princess had said, and
how he had thought her mad for the story. And when he had investigated
all patiently, and was convinced of the truth of Juanillo&rsquo;s
statement, he was full of indignation, and commanded the bad brothers
to be put to death, and his daughters banished for their silent
participation in their infamy. To Simple Johnny he gave a very hearty
embrace in the sight of the people, and not only made him heir to all
the kingdom, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>associated him with himself in the government,
beginning from that very day.</p>
<p>Simple Johnny, however, would not allow his brothers to be put to
death, but only deprived them of the right to reign, which might have
brought misery on the kingdom, and appointed them houses and money that
they might spend the rest of their days in harmless retirement.

<h2 class="main">TURIAN AND FLORETA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived once in very ancient times in Spain a
young prince, the Infante Turian. He was a very beautiful youth, and
the only child of his parents, King Canamor and his consort Leonela:
they were thus tempted to indulge him very much, and, as we should say,
to spoil him; in fact, he was allowed to have every thing he asked for,
and when any present or novel article of merchandise was brought to the
palace, if it happened to take his fancy, he got into a way of
expecting to have it for his own, and no one thought of thwarting
him.</p>
<p>One day there came a foreign merchant to the court, who, instead of
having a train of mules heavily laden with varieties of his wares to
suit all tastes and fancies, was quite alone and unattended, and
himself bore his whole stock. It consisted, indeed, of but one little
parcel easily stowed away in the folds of his cloak. The servants were
scandalized at such a mean apparatus, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>and would have driven him
away without letting him have a chance of addressing himself to their
masters, telling him if he had nothing more to show than the contents
of one little case, it was not worth while to trouble them. It was in
vain the merchant urged that what he had to show was of priceless
value, and in itself alone was worth all the mule-loads of other
merchants put together: they held it for idle raving, and bid him
begone.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that the Infante Turian was coming home at the
moment, and hearing the altercation, his curiosity was piqued to know
what it could be that could be counted so precious. He had horses, and
arms, and trappings, and gay clothes, and games, and baubles of every
sort, and he had wearied of them all. He had acquired them without
labour, and he consequently held them without esteem. Now there
appeared a chance of some quite fresh sensation; moreover, the merchant
himself had a strange air which fascinated him; again, his accent was
different from any he had heard before, and suggested that he brought
the productions of some climate which had not yet laid its stores at
his feet. Proud, too, to show his power in setting the man free from
the importunate scorn of the servants, he ordered them to stand back,
and then gave the strange merchant permission to open his store.</p>
<p>Assuming an air of mystery, which excited the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>young
prince still more, the merchant, however, now told him he must take him
to some private recess apart, as what he had to show must be seen only
by royal eyes. The prince accepted all conditions in his eagerness, and
was indeed rather flattered by this one. As soon as they were quite
alone, the strange merchant placed before him a portrait. Yes, nothing
but a portrait in a very simple frame! But it was <i>such</i> a
portrait that it quite turned poor Turian&rsquo;s head. He had never
before dreamt of any thing so beautiful; he went into ecstasies at
first sight, kissed it, gazed at it, paced up and down the hall with
it, raved about it, and grew almost frantic, when the strange merchant
at last went up to him and said it was time for him to go home, and he
must have the portrait to pack up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pack up again!&rdquo; cried the prince: &ldquo;why, I buy it
of you at triple, tenfold, an hundredfold its weight in
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant assured him it could not be sold; he required, indeed,
a considerable price for suffering it to be seen, but part with it he
could not, on any conditions whatever.</p>
<p>The prince threw his purse to him, and ordered him in no measured
terms to depart while the way was clear, otherwise he would set on him
the myrmidons from whom he had but now released him.</p>
<p>The strange merchant quietly picked up the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>purse,
counted out conscientiously the sum he had named as the price for the
sight of the picture, and laid down the rest; deliberately stowed away
his fee in his belt, and at the same time took from it, unperceived by
the prince, a little box of powder; then suddenly turning round, he
scattered its contents over his face, producing instant insensibility.
Prepared for the effect, he caught him in his arms, and laid him gently
on a bench, and then, possessing himself of his picture, he stealthily
left the castle, unperceived by all.</p>
<p>When the Infante Turian came to himself, some hours afterwards, of
course pursuit was vain; nor could any trace be learnt of the way the
stranger had taken.</p>
<p>The prince was furious that, at least, he had not learnt some clue
as to the original of the portrait, but there had not been time for a
word of inquiry. And when he set himself to recall every detail, all
that would come back to his mind was, that on the blue embroidery of
the white drapery which veiled the matchless form, he had made out in
curious characters the name <span class="sc">Floreta</span>. Armed with
this only guide, he determined to roam the world till he discovered the
real beauty whose ideal had so absorbed him.</p>
<p>King Canamor and Queen Leonela were inconsolable at the idea of
their only son leaving them on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>so wild an errand; but they had
never taught him obedience and self-control, and they could not move
him now. All their persuasions could obtain was his consent to be
accompanied by the <i>Conde</i> Dirlos, an ancient counsellor of great
wisdom and authority in the kingdom, who would know how to procure him
assistance by land and sea, in whatever enterprise he might be minded
to take in hand. But it was stipulated that he was to control him in
nothing: simply watch over him, and further his designs, so as to save
him from fatigue and danger.</p>
<p>On they wandered for a year and a day, meeting many adventures and
incurring many perils; but no one knew the name of Floreta. Wherever
they went it was still a foreign name. At last&mdash;it was just the
day year that the strange merchant had brought the portrait&mdash;their
travels brought them to a steep mountain-path, which led down to the
sea. At a turn of the winding road, just below them, a tall figure
appeared, wrapped in a long cloak, and wearing a high-peaked cap. The
prince gave a bound of joy, and shouted to the figure to halt. It paid
no heed, however. &ldquo;Stop! or you are dead!&rdquo; shouted the
prince, at the same time pointing an arrow with unerring aim at a spot
a little in advance of the moving figure. As if conscious of what was
going on, though he never moved his head, the strange
merchant&mdash;for it was he, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>prince had instantly
recognized him&mdash;stood still for an instant, as the bolt rattled in
the ground on which he would have stood had he pursued his way three
steps further, and then passed on unheeding. The prince shouted more
madly than before; but to no purpose; and in another moment the wind of
the road had taken him out of sight.</p>
<p>Madly the prince spurred his horse in pursuit, and reached the turn;
but no living form was to be seen. The rocks now resounded with the
cries and imprecations with which he adjured the magician&mdash;for
such he now rightly deemed him&mdash;to stand forth. At last, when he
was silent from sheer exhaustion, a low but commanding voice from the
depths of a neighbouring cave bade him listen, but, as he valued his
life, advance not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; cried the prince; &ldquo;nor torture me with
longer suspense. What must I do to find Floreta? I am prepared to go to
the end of the world, to undergo any hardship, any torture, to find
her; but find her I am determined: if you refuse your help, then by
help of some other; so you see it is idle to turn a deaf
ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By none other help but mine,&rdquo; answered the magician,
&ldquo;<i>can</i> you find Floreta; so your threats are vain. But if I
had not meant you to see her, I should not have shown you the portrait
at first, for I knew its influence could not be other than that it has
exercised. I am going to instruct you how <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>to reach her; but first
you must give me my guerdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it; ask what you will,&rdquo; interposed the impetuous
prince; &ldquo;ask my kingdom if you like; but keep me not in
suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only ask what is reasonable,&rdquo; answered the magician;
&ldquo;the real is worth a thousandfold the representation;&rdquo; and
he named a price equivalent to a thousand times the sum he had
originally received.</p>
<p>Without so much as waiting to reply, Turian turned to <i>Conde</i>
Dirlos and told him now was the time to fulfil his father&rsquo;s
behest by accomplishing this requirement, and begged him to raise the
money without an instant&rsquo;s loss of time.</p>
<p>The count remonstrated in vain, and in vain represented the miseries
he would be inflicting on the people by requiring, in so sudden a
manner, the levy of so large a sum. Turian, blinded by his passion, bid
him save his words, as nothing could change his purpose; and the
king&rsquo;s orders to obey him having been unconditional, <i>Conde</i>
Dirlos set out with a heavy heart to comply.</p>
<p>Ten days of anxious suspense during his absence were spent by the
prince in wandering over the rugged declivities of the coast: the
ardour of his excitement demanded to be fed with deeds of daring and
danger. When he was not so occupied, he was seated panting on the
topmost crags, scouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>the whole country with his eager
glance to descry the first impression of the return of the count, with
the means of pursuing his desperate resolve.</p>
<p>The day came at last. And afar off, first only like so many black
specks, but gradually revealing themselves as <i>Conde</i> Dirlos on
his faithful steed, and a long file of heavily-laden mules, came the
anxiously expected train. And now he never left his point of
observation; but cursed the sluggish hours, as he watched the team now
steering over the sandy plain, which seemed interminable in expanse,
unmeasured by landmarks; now toiling backwards and forwards up the
zig-zagged steep, with provoking seeming of being further off one hour
than the last, as at each wind they turned upon their steps; now
detached-liked spectres against the sky, as they crossed from one reach
of the lofty sierra to the next.</p>
<p>All things have an end, even Turian&rsquo;s anxious suspense; and as
the count at last neared the magician&rsquo;s cave, he descended at
break-neck pace to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the price,&rdquo; said the count, in sad and solemn
accents; &ldquo;but before rendering it out of your hands, stop and
consider it;&rdquo; and as he spoke he removed from the treasure the
brilliant red and yellow cloths, the royal colours of Spain, with which
it was covered. &ldquo;Here, from each province of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>your
father&rsquo;s dominions, is the due proportion of the tribute you have
demanded. See&mdash;will you spend it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prince darted forward to glance at the goodly sight of so much
gold, but drew back with horror.</p>
<p>What could he have seen to turn his flushed cheeks so deadly
pale?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count!&rdquo; he cried, choking with fury, &ldquo;what have
you brought to mock me? This is not coin. You have brought me tears,
burning tears, instead of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all the same,&rdquo; replied the count; &ldquo;I saw
you were infatuated, and I brought the money in this form, that the
sight might warn you of what you are doing, and by its sad horror
arrest you. There is time to return it back into the bosom of those
from whom it has been wrung, and no harm will have been done. But if
you persist, you will find the magician will take them for current
coin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so!&rdquo; chimed in the voice from the cave; &ldquo;it
is the money I like best. But I cannot stand dallying thus: if the
treasure be not handed over at once, the bargain is at an end, and you
never hear of me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only wanted this to quench any little spark of pity and misgiving
which the old count&rsquo;s judicious stratagem might have awakened. So
without further <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>loss of time the prince called to the magician to
come forth and take the spoil.</p>
<p>He was not slow to comply, and taking a handful of the weird
currency out of each mule-load, rang it on the rock, where it sounded
like the clanking of a captive&rsquo;s chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; he said in a satisfied tone, when he had
concluded his scrutiny. &ldquo;Now for my part of the bargain. I am not
of those who fail because I am paid beforehand: you will find me as
good as my word, and even better; for I will supply an item of the
bargain which you, impetuous youth, never thought to stipulate for,
though the most important of all. I will not only instruct you how to
see Floreta, I will give you moreover the means whereby, if she pleases
you, you can take her captive and bear her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, interrupt me not,&rdquo; he continued, as Turian,
nettled at the exposure of his want of diplomacy, was about to declare
that he had never thought of any other means to captivate her being
required but his own smile and his own strong arm; &ldquo;I must begin,
and have but time to complete my directions. You see yon castle on a
rock out at sea;&rdquo; and as his long bony finger pointed westward,
there seemed to be traced against the sky the form of a royal castle at
about three days&rsquo; journey, which Turian, who had for ten days
been beating about the coast, could have sworn was not to be seen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>there before. Nevertheless, fascinated by the
magician&rsquo;s commanding manner, he durst say nothing but a murmur
of assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that is your haven; take ship and steer for it. When you
reach the land throw down this token,&rdquo; and he gave into his hand
a fine coil of silken chains; &ldquo;follow its leadings till it take
you to Floreta, and if she please you, cast it round her, and she is
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he disappeared from sight, with the mules and their
burden.</p>
<p>Turian now once more reminded <i>Conde</i> Dirlos of his
father&rsquo;s command, and bid him provide him with the swiftest
galley on all the coasts of the kingdom, manned with the stoutest
rowers, and that with the utmost speed.</p>
<p>If the wise old count shrunk from the former mission, his horror was
but the greater at this one. He reminded the prince that when the king
had given his consent to the adventure, he had not contemplated any
other than a loyal undertaking, such as a noble prince might entertain:
he would never have trusted him on one of this nature.</p>
<p>Turian felt the force of the reproach, but lacked the strength of
character to command himself. Hurried on by his uncontrolled desire, he
bid the old man remember that the command to fulfil his orders was
quite unconditional, and there was no limit whatever named.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>The count owned this was unfortunately true, and as he could prevail
nothing by argument, set himself to remedy the Infante&rsquo;s
headstrong wilfulness by making the journey as safe as possible. He not
only insisted on having the galley examined as to its seaworthiness by
the most experienced shipwrights, and selected the steadiest oarsmen to
man the banks, but appointed a consultation of all the astronomers of
the kingdom to name the day when they might be sure of safe passage,
free from winds. It was pronounced that a storm was just then impending
which would last ten days, and after that there would be ten days of
fair weather, so that if they allowed ten days for their preparations,
they would have time to make the journey and return in all
security.</p>
<p>The delay seemed another age to the Infante; nevertheless he was now
so near the accomplishment of his object that it passed swiftly enough
in the enjoyment of the pleasure of anticipation. The count, too, found
some relief to his anxieties in the fact that the storm came on at the
predicted moment, giving him great confidence that the halcyon days
predicted to succeed might be surely counted on.</p>
<p>They came duly; and a shout of admiration rose from the people on
the shore as the gallant vessel moved out over the face of the blue,
sunlit waters, which glittered as if showered over with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>every
precious stone at each stroke of the countless oars. And those on board
were equally entranced with the gorgeous sight as they seemed to soar
along over the soft bosom of the crystal deep; and the noble outline of
their native mountains, peak above peak, from the verdant slopes where
the cattle browsed lazily, to the wild steeps where even the mountain
goats ceased to find a footing, receded with ever-varying forms of
beauty from their sight.</p>
<p>It was not on <i>these</i> that Turian&rsquo;s eye rested. His
glance was bent on the castle for which they were making, and his
thoughts were bound up in the beauteous treasure within. Such
confidence had he in the magician&rsquo;s word, that he had laid his
arms aside and held only the silken chain that was to be his guiding
line to happiness; and toyed with it, thinking how he would throw it
round the prized form of the portrait&rsquo;s original, and how he
would gaze on her when she was his.</p>
<p>While he was still wrapt in these thoughts they drew near to the
mysterious shore, and every one was occupied in admiring the strength
and noble proportions of the castle. But Turian had no thought but for
the treasure it contained. Springing lightly on to the land, he lost no
time in fulfilling the magician&rsquo;s injunctions; and sure enough
the chain uncoiled itself, and, wriggling with a serpent&rsquo;s
motion, went straight before him to a gate in the castle wall. It was
unlocked, and Turian, pushing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>it aside, gained entrance to a
sumptuous garden, at one end of which was a shady arbour, and in a bank
of perfumed roses Floreta herself lay asleep. How his heart beat at the
sight! Just as she had seemed in the portrait; just as he had pictured
her in his sleeping and waking dreams. Riveted to the spot, he stood
contemplating her, as well he might, for her complexion was white as
snow, or rather as pure crystal, and tinted as the fresh rose yet on
the rose-tree<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1309src" href="#xd21e1309"
name="xd21e1309src">1</a>.</p>
<p>The cautious count, fearful of some ambush, had marshalled the crew
of the galley into a guard to track his steps noiselessly and be ready
in case of sudden attack. The play of light upon their arms passing in
sudden reflection over the scene woke the Infante from his reverie, and
roused him to action. The coiling silken links readily embraced
Floreta&rsquo;s limbs, and such was their hidden power that, though she
woke at the Infante&rsquo;s approach, she was powerless to resist or
cry.</p>
<p>Thus he bore her to the galley, and the men having resumed their
places on the rowers&rsquo; banks, in silent order they pushed off
unperceived by any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span>one on the island, for it was the hour of the
noontide rest.</p>
<p>But soon Floreta&rsquo;s maidens, coming to attend her rising,
discovered her loss. The king her father and all the people quickly
gathered their arms and ran wildly in every direction, till at last
they saw the strange vessel making fast away, and they doubted not it
was carrying off their princess, but they could only stand on the shore
throwing up their arms and crying in powerless despair.</p>
<p>Turian had in the mean time removed the chain from his prize; and
thus freed from the spell, Floreta, too, held out her arms towards her
parents and countrymen, and cried unavailingly on them for help.
Turian, incapable of contradicting her, yet incapable also of giving
her up, contented himself with admiring her at a distance, and let her
spend herself in lamentations at first; but when the good galleon had
put sufficient distance between itself and the castle to destroy the
freshness of the impression of parting, the Infante commanded his
people to cast anchor that he might try his power of consoling her more
at ease. And indeed, it was not long before his sweet words of
admiration and his protestations of affection and devotion seemed to
succeed in reconciling her to her situation; before long they were very
good friends and very happy, and the sun shone and the sea sparkled,
and nature smiled, and all seemed fair and bright. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless the prudent old count had his misgivings. True, there
were yet several more days of the promised calm before them, but he
felt he should never be easy till he had his charge safe at home again;
so he urged the Infante to give orders to put under way once more, and
right glad was he to feel the bark moving towards the port and in good
time to reach home before the next storm.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Quando Dios quiere</p>
<p class="line">En sereno lluve<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1349src"
href="#xd21e1349" name="xd21e1349src">2</a>,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">says the proverb, and while they were singing and
making merry, and dancing to amuse Floreta, suddenly the sky became
overcast and the wind sprang up, and the waves dashed against the
bulwarks, and instead of being able to row the vessel into port the
oarsmen could hardly keep their seats. Then in the midst of their
fright and horror and piteous cries for help, an ancient seaman stood
up, and having commanded silence, harangued the crew, and told them
that they might be sure the tempest was sent them because they had the
strange damsel on board; that if they would save their lives they must
bid defiance to the Infante&rsquo;s wishes, and take him from her and
cast her into the sea. The danger to all was manifest and terrible; any
way out of it was preferable to succumbing, so the old man found a
willing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>audience. The dismayed count had but time to rush
in to the Infante and tell him of the mutiny before the angry mariners
had already burst into his presence. If they were for a moment
staggered by pity at sight of the exceeding beauty of Floreta, and by
Turian&rsquo;s agonized assurances that the fearful sacrifice would
have no effect upon the storm, the old mariner&rsquo;s voice overruled
their hesitation and rendered them pitiless as the blast.</p>
<p>Then at his command they tore the Infante from off Floreta, to whom
he clung declaring that they should not destroy her without him, but
that he would go down into the deep with her, and they bound him fast
hand and foot and took Floreta, too full of terror to resist or cry, to
throw her into the raging sea. But before they had completed the
sacrifice, the cries of the prince, seconded as he was by the prudent
old count, ever ready to second a middle course, prevailed, and instead
of committing her to the deep, they set her on an island past which the
bark was drifting, Turian thinking in his own mind that as soon as the
fury of the storm was spent he should be able to induce them to put
back and fetch her off.</p>
<p>The old seaman knew what was in his mind, and he knew that the work
was but half done. He inveighed that the half-measure was useless; he
predicted that the storm would not thereby be quenched. But it was too
late to listen to him now: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href=
"#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>they were carried past the land where
Floreta was; and it was beyond their efforts to go back to fulfil his
purpose now. Meanwhile, as he had predicted, the tempest raged higher
and higher; the oarsmen were powerless: but the bark drifted nearer and
nearer home; and at last, just as a great wave dashed against it and
broke it up, they were brought just so near to land that they could
swim to shore. One young and vigorous oarsman took charge of the old
count, who was rendered more unfit for the feat by dismay at the
ill-success of his mission even than by the weakness of his age. But
none looked after the Infante, for he was known to be the expertest
swimmer of all the country round.</p>
<p>It was not till the hull had heeled over and gone down that they
remembered they had bound him hand and foot, and he could not escape.
And so he, who was the cause of all, alone was lost. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE BLOOD-STAIN OF THE ALC&Aacute;ZAR OF SEVILLE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of all the beautiful things which are to be seen at
Seville, there is perhaps none which engrosses the attention as the
alc&aacute;zar&mdash;so called because built after the fashion of a
Moorish palace. To the traveller unacquainted with the East it affords
a practical realization of the famed elaboration of Moorish
magnificence. It is not very certain whether in it Pedro the Cruel
erected a new foundation, or restored an old one remaining from the
time of the Moorish occupation; but he certainly left nothing wanting
to make it the worthy habitation of one of the most powerful monarchs
of the time<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1370src" href="#xd21e1370" name=
"xd21e1370src">1</a>. The present century has not been wanting to the
example thus set; and by dint of the artistic care bestowed upon it,
its beauties shine now as brilliantly as at the moment of their first
completion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>The gardens, with their groves of plantains,
datunas, tunales, myrtles, box-trees, and oranges, may appear stiff to
an English eye; but be there in the summer, and you readily realize the
luxury of paths so contrived as to be always in the shade, and which,
when this even is too hot, can be cooled down by turning on a flow of
icy water over the tiles which pave them.</p>
<p>It is in the interior, however, that the greatest luxuriance of
imagination has been displayed. It is all one blaze of dazzling tints,
such as, one would think, no one but some of Aladdin&rsquo;s genii
could have produced. The walls are panelled with a delicate
embroidery-like fretwork of every gorgeous hue; the roofs cieled with
seeming liquid gold, suspended in burnished drops. It is the dazzling
image of all one has dreamt of Byzantine or Persian colouring; it is
like being in the fairy palace which was all one large prism. It might
have been imagined by mad genii, and executed by frantic fairies. It
might be the laboratory where tints are prepared for rainbows and
tropical sunsets, or where the painting of peacocks and butterflies,
humming-birds, and exotic flowers is devised. Or it might be the
jewel-storehouse of some thrice-rich monarch, to whom emeralds and
rubies are plentiful as figs and peaches, and all in cabinets of
wrought gold.</p>
<p>Amid all this splendour there is one sad, dark <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>spot,
which has outlived the wear of five centuries, to stand a witness of
the judgment of Heaven overtaking the tyrant and the oppressor. Pedro
the Cruel was the only Christian monarch who ever indulged himself with
such a nest; and I fear the life he led within it was not what that of
a Christian monarch ought to be. Not to speak of his other faults, his
thirst for blood was so great as to be surpassed only by the atrocities
ascribed to Nero. Whoever displeased him in any way was summarily put
to death, and that sometimes amid cruel tortures, without form of
trial.</p>
<p>An old ballad has lately been found, which arranges in rhyming order
the whole catalogue of names and qualities of the distinguished people
whose lives were forfeited by his hand, or at his behest, which served
the people to perpetuate their detestation of his character. There was
Don Garcilaso, and his little brothers Don Juan and Don Diego; the
Infante of Aragon, his cousin; Don Fernando, a knight of high renown;
the noble youth Don Luis de Albuquerque; and Peralvarez Osorio, who had
injured him in nothing. Then the Queen of Aragon, to whom his father
was brother; and Do&ntilde;a Blanca, his own wife; Do&ntilde;a Juana
and Do&ntilde;a Isabel, high ladies both, of the Asturias; and
Gutierrez of Toledo, and the Archbishop his brother; Don I&ntilde;igo
d&rsquo;Orozco, who fought him in the field; and Don Suero, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>good prelate, Archbishop of Santiago, and also
Bermejo de Granada. And besides these many more, both hidalgos and
caballeros.</p>
<p>Thus at last his wickedness outgrew the people&rsquo;s patience; and
when the good Henry of Trastamare rose up against him, and provoked him
to fight, and slew him, they all hailed the act as the execution of the
sentence of Divine Justice, and acclaimed Henry as their deliverer and
their ruler in his stead; for Alonso, the son of his unblessed union
with Maria Padilla, whom he had forced the people to acknowledge for
his successor, had been carried off by sudden death soon after; and
though the daughter of his lawful marriage had married our own John of
Gaunt, all his reputation, and that of the Black Prince his father,
could not outweigh their disinclination for a foreign king.</p>
<p>With regard to the mode of Pedro the Cruel&rsquo;s death, the more
credited account is that his end was an episode of the siege of
Montiel, where he had sought to hide himself from the victorious
pursuit of Henry de Trastamare. Local tradition loves to think it found
him out with poetical justice, and left its stain in the very hall
which had been the scene of his wanton excesses; where others had
fallen at his command, and whence the decree had gone forth for the
relentless execution of his victims. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">THE ADVENTURES OF DO&Ntilde;A JOSEFA RAMIREZ Y
MARMOLEJO.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Do&ntilde;a Josefa Ramirez was the only child of noble
parents of Valencia. She grew up in every virtue, and joined the wisdom
of a Minerva to the beauty of a Venus. She was hardly eighteen before
various noble youths were contending for her good graces; but of them
all the only one she favoured was Don Pedro de Valenzuela, who, though
of noble lineage, yet did not possess the fortune or position that her
parents thought should entitle him who wedded with the descendant of
the illustrious houses of Ramirez and Marmolejo.</p>
<p>Little Do&ntilde;a Josefa did not think of all this; she was much
attached to her boyish playmate, and hoped that as her parents were
very fond of her she would one day win their consent to receive his
attentions; in the mean time, she thoughtlessly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>listened
with great delight when he came and sang a love song under her windows,
and even, I am afraid, sometimes came to the <i lang=
"es">reja</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1401src" href="#xd21e1401"
name="xd21e1401src">1</a> to give him a coy look of thanks and
encouragement.</p>
<p>One day, as the youthful Don Pedro de Valenzuela was thus pleasantly
occupied, he had finished his song and was waiting to see if a pair of
bright eyes would not come sparkling behind the <i lang="es">reja</i>,
when, his thoughts being quite engrossed by this expectation, and his
attention abstracted from every thing around him, he suddenly found
himself attacked from behind by two men who were wrapt up in their
cloaks and masked so that he could not recognize them, nor indeed had
he time to think about it, for before he could even draw his sword they
had stretched him dead upon the ground; he could only cry out
Josefa&rsquo;s name, and expire.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Josefa was thrilled with dread at the tone in which her
name was uttered; it seemed to portend something dreadful, such as she
had never known before. She flew to the window, and by what remained of
the gloaming light, she saw her lover&rsquo;s body stretched lifeless
on the ground, while the assassins had escaped without leaving a trace
behind.</p>
<p>The terrible sight seemed to change Do&ntilde;a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>Josefa&rsquo;s nature: all her woman&rsquo;s
weakness was quenched within her, and every thought bound up in the one
determination of avenging the precious life which had been so cruelly
sacrificed for love of her. She tore off her woman&rsquo;s gear with
the indignation of an enraged lioness, and arrayed herself in a full
cavalier&rsquo;s suit, with a <i lang="es">montera</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1417src" href="#xd21e1417" name="xd21e1417src">2</a>
to cover her head and an ample cloak to hide her from scrutiny. Then
she took a belt well furnished with arms, and a sword and blunderbuss
to boot; and then a purse with two hundred doubloons; thus accoutred
she wandered forth in quest of Don Pedro de Valenzuela&rsquo;s
assassins, making her way in all haste out of Valencia, for she knew
the assassins would not long have remained there.</p>
<p>Hiding herself in the mountains by day, and taking the most
unfrequented paths by night, she wandered on till she came to Murcia,
and there she resolved to take up her abode for some little time to
rest, and also to learn what she might chance to hear.</p>
<p>Here, in her cavalier&rsquo;s dress, she walked about on the
promenades, joined knots of speakers in the public <i>plazas</i>, and
at night sat down at the card-tables and other places of resort, every
where <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>keeping her ears open to drink in any word any one
might let fall about her lover&rsquo;s assassination. One night, as she
was sitting at a table carelessly shuffling a pack of cards, she heard
two gentlemen talking very earnestly, and some words they dropped made
her strain all her attention to catch the thread of their
discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are gone on; I am sure of it; and some hours
ago,&rdquo; asseverated the first speaker, as if he had been
contradicted before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; rejoined the other, in a tone of yielding
conviction; &ldquo;it was not likely they should remain in the country.
No doubt it is as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Do&ntilde;a Josefa, approaching the
speakers with a courtly bow, for she could restrain her curiosity no
longer, &ldquo;but I think you were speaking of some gentlemen of
Seville.... I am of Seville, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Valencia,&rdquo; politely rejoined the gentleman, fairly
caught in the trap. Had Josefa said she was of Valencia, his mouth
would have been sealed for fear of betraying secrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, of Valencia!&rdquo; she continued, assuming a
tone of disappointment; and then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, she
added, as if indifferent, &ldquo;I think you spoke as if concerned for
some friends in trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not <i>friends</i>,&rdquo; answered the person addressed,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>with a slight shudder; &ldquo;we had but the most
distant acquaintance with them; but they called on us yesterday to ask
us to help them out of a difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that is very often the way of the world,&rdquo; replied
Do&ntilde;a Josefa, for she felt she must keep the conversation going
till she could get all the information she wanted, though scarcely
seeing how to bring it to the right point without exciting suspicions.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant now it was a regular piece of Valencian
roguery<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1449src" href="#xd21e1449" name=
"xd21e1449src">3</a>; they came with some pitiful pretence, begging,
I&rsquo;ll be bound; and I dare say at this moment are laughing at the
ease with which their doleful story loosed your purse-strings; ha, ha,
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silvery laugh and biting tone of the young cavalier stung the
Murcians to the quick; it seemed a point of honour to justify
themselves from the censure of having been cajoled. The friend who had
all this time remained silent, not quite liking the freedom, but now
completely reassured by the noble bearing, fair smooth brow, and
perhaps also by the sad but winning glance of the young stranger, here
joined in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a fine knowledge of the world, young friend, and
such wise words do not often come from lips on which the hair is not
yet grown. Nevertheless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href=
"#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>there was no deception on this
occasion: I never saw men more blasted with fear and shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; pursued Josefa as carelessly as she could, for she
saw she was now on the right track, &ldquo;it is easy for a Valencian
to assume a look of shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, man, these were not men used to shame; these were true
men and gentlemen of blood&mdash;blood as blue as any blood in
Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! they told you so!&rdquo; rejoined Josefa with an
incredulous shrug, which she knew must bring out the names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it was no less than Don Leonardo and Don Gaspar
Contreras!&rdquo; broke in the other speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Leonardo and Don Gaspar Contreras!&rdquo; ejaculated
Josefa, this time hardly master of her contending emotions; yet knowing
the importance of playing her part to the end, she added in a tone of
thundering indignation,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can stand there and tell me that Don Leonardo and Don
Gaspar Contreras came before you bowed with a look of shame,&mdash;to
beg alms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, fair sir,&rdquo; rejoined the Murcians; &ldquo;and
if you still have doubts you can go to Valencia, and seek for them; you
will not find them there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray, sir, why should I not find Don Leonardo and Don
Gaspar Contreras in their noble <i>palacio</i> at Valencia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they dare not show their faces there,&rdquo; replied
one. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are at this moment riding for their lives to the
sea coast, and you would be more likely to find them at
Cartagena,&rdquo; exclaimed the other at the same moment.</p>
<p>Josefa had now learnt pretty well all she desired to know;
nevertheless, to make quite sure of her facts, she sat down again,
pushing chairs towards the Murcians, and continued in a more pacific
and friendly tone,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse me, gentlemen, if the idea of coupling shame
with the name of Contreras came upon me as so strange and unaccountable
a conjunction, that I could not bring myself to accept it at first; but
I am fain to take it on your honourable testimony. But pray tell me,
what <i>can</i> have happened to bring this about? I have a cousin
married to a Contreras, and whatever affects the honour of their house
affects my own. It must have been some terrible necessity reduced them
to this plight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old story&mdash;jealousy working in ill-regulated
minds!&rdquo; answered the elder speaker. &ldquo;It seems Valencia
possesses some monster of beauty, which has turned the hearts of all
her cavaliers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Josefa Ramirez y Marmolejo!&rdquo; interposed the
younger Murcian apologetically, as though he thought it a reproach not
to have the name of the beauty of the day on the tip of his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the young lady, it seems, preferred to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>every
one else of Valencia a certain Don Pedro de
Valenzuela&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josefa had managed to preserve her composure, in spite of her
emotion at hearing her attractions canvassed by the two strangers, but
at mention of Don Pedro&rsquo;s name the blood fairly left her cheeks.
To hide her embarrassment, she dropped her glove and stooped to pick it
up, till she had summoned the colour back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other gallants,&rdquo; continued the speaker, not heeding
the interruption, &ldquo;were the more nettled at this, that he was not
of so high estate as they&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josefa could hardly refrain from exclaiming that he was better than
all of them put together; but she coughed and bit her lip, and by a
supreme effort kept the tears out of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when they found they were slighted, while he was allowed
to come and strum night after night at the <i lang="es">reja</i>, they
grew furious. None were more indignant than the two cousins Leonardo
and Gaspar de Contreras. One night, as they were passing casually by
Do&ntilde;a Josefa&rsquo;s house, and saw Don Pedro standing under the
window, basking in the smiles of the lady, while they had to wander by
as unrecognized outcasts, their blood was up, and without reflection or
premeditation, they set upon him there and then, without calling upon
him to defend himself, and killed him like a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what ails you, fair sir?&rdquo; ejaculated the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>speaker, as he observed poor Josefa making vain
efforts to look indifferent, and trembling from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir, thank you,&rdquo; stammered Josefa bravely;
&ldquo;the wind is high to-night. With your permission I will
e&rsquo;en close this window.<span class="corr" id="xd21e1516" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The moment&rsquo;s seclusion from the
company, and the gasp of air thus gained, enabled her to appear once
more a not too eager listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can now understand why the Contreras are running away
like&mdash;<i>dogs</i>,&rdquo; she replied, not without some little
display of feeling, for she burned to bandy back against the assassins
the epithet which, though it had not been breathed, had so nearly been
applied to her lover.</p>
<p>A very little more talk elicited that the cousins expected to find a
ship sailing from Cartagena in three days; in the mean time they were
making the best of their way to the coast. Worn out with the long
tension of suppressed emotion, Josefa was glad to retire as soon as
there was a break in the conversation.</p>
<p>Next morning she purchased a horse, fleet as the wind, and arrived
the same night at Cartagena; and here she once more set to work to find
out the retreat of the assassins. In this, fortune again favoured her.
For having placed her horse in a stable, and hired a room in the
principal inn for herself, she sat down beside an open <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>window,
while she thought upon the plan to pursue. As she sat here, her
attention was arrested by a conversation going on between two men
seated under a leafy <i>parral</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1532src"
href="#xd21e1532" name="xd21e1532src">4</a>, which effectually
concealed her from their sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to-night, so finely arrayed?&rdquo;
inquired one of the voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where every one is going,&rdquo; responded the other;
&ldquo;to the house of Don Juan Mancilla, for he gives a right noble
banquet in honour of two guests he has staying with him, natives of
Valencia. He is to give a representation of a comedy, and many other
fine things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Josefa held her breath, and leant further out of the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something I heard of their arrival yesterday morning,&rdquo;
rejoined the first voice. &ldquo;But why all this haste? Methinks the
comedy would have been the better got up for one or two days&rsquo;
rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you see, the Valencians take ship at half-past twelve
this very night,&rdquo; replied the other; and then in a lower key,
&ldquo;They are even now running from Valencia for some charge of a
duel there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, man, hold!&rdquo; warily ejaculated the first voice;
&ldquo;who knows who may overhear you?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Josefa had overheard enough; her work now up to
half-past twelve was but to learn the situation of Don Juan
Mancilla&rsquo;s house, and the way thence to the harbour; no difficult
task, for Don Juan Mancilla&rsquo;s was one of the first names in
Cartagena; and near the landing-place she met a garrulous servant of
the Contreras, who was easily led to speak of his masters&rsquo;
movements. Between the two points lay an <i lang="es">alameda</i>, or
promenade, planted with poplars, such as adorns the outskirts of every
Spanish town, affording a most convenient spot for the rencontre for
which she had now with beating heart to lie in wait.</p>
<p>The tress which on that last sad night she had severed from her
lover&rsquo;s fair young head, and which now alone remained of him who
had been all to her, in her hand, she paced backwards and forwards
under the pollard poplars, like a knight keeping watch before a sacred
shrine. Her thoughts wrapt in the absorbing memories of the past, and
the fantastic part fate had assigned to herself, she had taken no note
of how the hours had sped by, and when the clocks chimed out the hour
of mid-night, it came upon her as a sudden warning. Not many minutes
more had elapsed, before she perceived two cavaliers advancing towards
her, whom her eye, practised by long acquaintance, readily recognized
as the game she had come so far to seek. Their loud talk, swaggering
mien, lofty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>stature, and moreover the clanking of their swords
as they walked, reminding that in Valencia the Contreras bore the
reputation of the most accomplished fencers of all the country round,
might have made a less resolute heart faint even then, and give up the
enterprise. But Do&ntilde;a Josefa never flinched. With one foot firmly
planted on the path, and resting on the other as a kind of prop, placed
in position to support her against any attempt to thrust her aside, she
stood firmly and calmly waiting their approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Leonardo, and you, Don Gaspar Contreras!&rdquo; she said,
as soon as they had advanced within hearing, &ldquo;know ye, who I
am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another time, good friend,&rdquo; said Don Leonardo
impatiently, and tried to pass on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pressed, and have but time to join our ship,&rdquo;
said Don Gaspar; and he endeavoured, though not without courtesy, to
make his way past her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must hear me, Se&ntilde;ores de Contreras,&rdquo;
rejoined Do&ntilde;a Josefa in a hollow voice; &ldquo;and when you have
heard me, you will never want a ship more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, this is more than pleasantry!&rdquo; exclaimed Don
Leonardo, getting angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make way, good sir; you see we are pressed for time,&rdquo;
said Don Gaspar, more conciliatingly; for he felt it was no time for
picking a quarrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no pleasantry, indeed!&rdquo; Do&ntilde;a Josefa had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>replied almost before he spoke; &ldquo;but most
serious earnest. Se&ntilde;ores de Contreras, again I ask, Do you know
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this trifling mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Don Leonardo,
hotly, and at the same time putting his hand on his sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; replied Josefa, calmly and
solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;It means that you are called to answer with your
vile lives for the noble life of Don Pedro Valenzuela, whom you
treacherously slew without so much as calling on him to draw. <i>My</i>
sword is the sword of justice, not of the assassin; <i>yet</i> I call
on you to defend yourselves, if you dare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good sir, you rave; we are not those you seek; and we know
not who you are!&rdquo; interposed Don Gaspar, putting his hand on Don
Leonardo&rsquo;s sword-arm, for he had already drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have twice asked you if you do not know me,&rdquo; answered
Josefa. &ldquo;Now, then, I tell you: I am Do&ntilde;a Josefa Ramirez y
Marmolejo. Have I not a right to avenge the blood of Don Pedro
Valenzuela?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! so brave anon, you would now make this pretence of
womanhood a shield. Methinks your tongue knows not the timidity of
woman, and that your arms are no woman&rsquo;s toys,&rdquo; blurted out
Don Leonardo contemptuously, despite of Don Gaspar&rsquo;s
warnings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw! Don Leonardo,&rdquo; commanded Josefa; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>&ldquo;nor waste more time in words. I seek no
quarter, nor&mdash;give any!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At you then!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Leonardo, rendered furious
by her impassibility, and breaking away from Don Gaspar&rsquo;s
hold.</p>
<p>Josefa awaited his onset firmly, her drawn sword extended in her
hand, like a statue of the avenging angel. Don Leonardo rushing at her,
blind with rage, thrust himself right upon her rapier, which pierced
him through and through; and, before he had time to utter a cry, he
fell a lifeless corpse at Don Gaspar&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Don Gaspar, who had no idea that there was any truth in
Josefa&rsquo;s declaration of her sex, felt no inclination to measure
his sword against so successful an antagonist; but, in order not to
appear to avoid the fray ignominiously, bent down and busied himself
with the effort to remove the body of his cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your turn now, Don Gaspar!&rdquo; said the avenging
angel calmly, having just withdrawn her sword from the breast of her
prostrate victim. &ldquo;Stand on guard, for your hour has
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This confident assertion, and the conviction that the encounter
could not be escaped, excited Don Gaspar almost to the same pitch of
indignation as Don Leonardo had displayed, notwithstanding that he was
by nature less irascible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think not to find so easy a victory a second time!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters little,&rdquo; replied the lady calmly; &ldquo;you
have killed my life already, when you killed Don Pedro!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she was yet speaking, Don Gaspar had already rushed to the
encounter; and she, standing with her trusty sword prepared to meet
him, sent his body to measure the ground, and his soul to its account,
after the same manner that she had served Don Leonardo.</p>
<p>Meantime the bandying of angry words and the clash of steel had not
been unheard by the guests, who were even then traversing the <i lang=
"es">alameda</i>, as the banquet of Don Juan Mancilla broke up. Quickly
as the contest had been carried through there was still time for many
persons to assemble, and there was every chance of Josefa being caught
and handed over to justice. All sank away, however, before the high and
innocent glance of her flashing eyes and the noble mien, which stood
surety hers had been no vulgar aim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sanctuary of S. Francis may yet be reached,&rdquo;
whispered an old nobleman, who perceived at a glance that the young
stranger belonged to his order, which he had rather not see subjected
to the ordeal of a public inquisition. &ldquo;Here, boy, follow me.
Courage!&rdquo; he added, as he observed she had hardly energy left to
move from the spot; &ldquo;we shall soon be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Josefa, so courageous anon, felt palsied at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>the
sight of the advancing strangers, and the apprehension of having all
her motions and man&oelig;uvres sifted in the vulgar sieve of public
opinion. She knew what she had done could only be judged and
appreciated by the few who had felt what she had felt. This very terror
at last nerved her to take the old man&rsquo;s counsel; and so,
wrapping her wide cloak around her, she followed at a little distance,
delicacy prompting her to avoid appearing to belong to him, so that he
might not be compromised through his good-nature. All those who were
about at the time were men of similar position, who judged that the
course adopted was the wisest, and so Josefa and her guide proceeded to
their journey&rsquo;s end without molestation. Arrived at the church
door, the old nobleman pointed to the entrance and passed on his
way.</p>
<p>Josefa began to explain to an old Brother who kept the door the
misadventure which had brought her thither, but it was more than she
could do to conclude the narrative, her feeble powers were already
overstrained, and she sank fainting at his feet. For several days she
was carefully tended in the hospital; and one day, when the noise of
the affair had blown over, and the knowledge that she had taken refuge
in the Sanctuary had quieted the pursuit of justice, she sent a
messenger to the inn to fetch the swift courser she had left there on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>arriving, and under favour of the darkness of the
evening set out to return to Valencia.</p>
<p>She had travelled a considerable distance without accident, when
suddenly she perceived three travellers coming towards her; the moon
shone brightly, and her keen eyes, quickened by natural feminine
apprehension, were not slow to make out that they were of the kind most
unwelcome under the circumstances, though to meet any one was awkward
enough.</p>
<p>She had no time to consider what she should do, for the strangers
were advancing at a rapid pace; nor were they slow to declare their
character. The chief called out to her before they had even come up, to
&lsquo;stand and deliver.&rsquo; The only circumstance in her favour
was that they stood on the narrow ledge of a mountain path, the one
closely packed behind the other as one man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is idle to attempt to resist us, young gallant,&rdquo;
cried the leader as he saw her draw her sword; &ldquo;we are too many
for one even as valiant as I dare say you fancy yourself; besides,
there are more of us behind who will soon be up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Josefa uttered no boast, she took up a firm position;
her fine well-tempered rapier extended in her hand received them on its
point, and threaded them through as they came, one behind the
other.</p>
<p>But, alack! the strong men, in the contortions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>of their
last agony, overstepped the narrow footing of the path, and fell over
the brink, carrying in their bodies the trusty sword which had stood
her in such good stead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more of us behind who will soon be up!&rdquo; she
repeated to herself, as with dogged determination she still held up
against her misfortunes, and proceeded on her way for a wind or two of
the path without disturbing incidents. One more turn and there stood
before her three more bandits in the same order as the last. She had
her <i lang="es">trabuco</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1645src" href=
"#xd21e1645" name="xd21e1645src">5</a> ready to aim, and her aim was so
steady, that before they had time to perceive her purpose, her ball had
pierced through the three of them, and they were sent rolling over the
precipice, to join the bodies of their companions below.</p>
<p>Whether Josefa thought that these exploits might bring her into
fresh conflict with the arm of the law, or whether the fresh horrors
gave a gloomy turn to her mind, and indisposed her for venturing home,
I know not; but whatever her motive, she made up her mind at this point
of the journey to continue her wanderings only as far as Barcelona, and
there take ship to make a pilgrimage to Rome.</p>

</div>
<p>The sea was not much more propitious to poor Do&ntilde;a
Josefa&rsquo;s fortunes than the land had been. The vessel on which she
had embarked had not been two days out before it was attacked by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>Algerine Corsairs, who took every soul on board
prisoners, and carried them off to Africa, where they were sold as
slaves.</p>
<p>It fell to Josefa&rsquo;s lot to be bought by a rich renegade of
Tunis, whom she served under the name of Pedro, a name she deemed she
had a certain right to take. The renegade was much pleased with her
soft discreet manners, and general superiority and uprightness of
character; and soon advanced her to the post of steward over his
household, having her first instructed in the Arabic tongue. Things
went smoothly enough for some time; but when she had been in this
service about three years, it happened that one day, when the master
was gone out hunting, a maid-servant, who held a high place in the
household, and whose forwardness the supposed Pedro had often noticed,
came and made a free confession of an irrepressible affection for him,
and entreated him to marry her. Josefa, much annoyed at the incident,
could only answer that it was impossible: for she had not confidence in
the girl to trust her with her secret.</p>
<p>The enraged girl, furious at the repulse, swore by Mahomet to be
revenged; accordingly, no sooner was the master returned, than she went
to him with every token of distress and indignation, and accused Pedro
of abusing his power as steward of the house, and having sought to
force her to marry him although she had resisted because he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>was a Christian, and the law of Mahomet forbade
such an union.</p>
<p>The master, highly incensed at the perfidy of the slave he had
treated with so much forbearance and indulgence, ordered him to be
thrown into a dungeon and starved to death, without hearing any
defence.</p>
<p>Such would indeed have been Josefa&rsquo;s fate, but that one of the
slaves who respected her brought her daily the scanty means of
subsistence she was able to secure. At the end of several days the
master, coming to the dungeon to see what had befallen, was greatly
provoked to find her not only alive but comparatively well, and took up
a cord to administer summary chastisement.</p>
<p>This indignity was more than Josefa could endure; to avert it, she
begged him to listen to her; told him she could easily prove the
falsity of the accusation under which she was suffering, seeing she was
a woman.</p>
<p>The master was delighted to hear the exculpation of his favourite
slave, and immediately had her released and reinstated in her
authority, and the shameless accuser consigned to the same prison.</p>
<p>From this time he continued to extend his favour and confidence
towards her: of all the people about him who shared his pleasures and
his riches, she was the only one to whom he could talk <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>of the
absorbing agony of his soul, the remorse for having renounced his
religion and become a renegade. The result was that he one day
announced to her that he had made arrangements for realizing the
greater part of his fortune, which he divided in two parts, one of
which he bestowed on her; with the other he had resolved to go to Rome
in pilgrimage and endow a shrine, where he would pass the remainder of
his days in prayer and penance.</p>
<p>He had found a merchant of his acquaintance who would take them in
his ship to Alicante, whence he would start again for Rome, and Josefa
would be free either to continue her journey thither or return to
Valencia.</p>
<p>Josefa&rsquo;s desire of once more embracing her parents made her
elect the latter course. Their plan was executed to the letter without
hindrance.</p>
<p>Arrived once more at Valencia, Josefa was not slow to find her way
to her father&rsquo;s palace. An old servant who had been in the house
before she was born, and watched her grow up, opened the door, but did
not recognize her, which she took for a presage that she might come
unknown into her parents&rsquo; presence also.</p>
<p>She found them seated side by side, and bewailing the loss of their
only child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to tell you,&rdquo; she broke in, &ldquo;that
your child is now in this very city; three years and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>a half
she has been a captive slave in Tunis, though not serving as a slave,
for she was absolute master of the household of her owner. And at the
end of that time he gave her her liberty together with a large fortune
in money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, tell us where is she!&rdquo; ejaculated Don Juan
Ramirez; &ldquo;let our aged eyes rest on her again before we die, so
shall we be consoled for our troubles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Do&ntilde;a Josefa threw off her disguise, and falling on her
knees before them, entreated their pardon for all her errors and all
the anxiety she had given them.</p>
<p>Having received that, she told them she had determined to pass the
rest of her days in penitence in a convent, which she did with their
hearty approval; and in this kind of life she spent many years,
affording a lively and edifying example to all. And thus ended in peace
the tragic adventures of Do&ntilde;a Josefa Ramirez y Marmolejo.

<h2 class="main">THE STEEPLE OF COVE&Ntilde;A.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a very little distance from Madrid you may already
discern against the horizon the outline of the steeple of
Cove&ntilde;a, which is one of the handsomest edifices of New Castile;
and all the thitherward way it is before you, standing against the sky
as a landmark to the traveller.</p>
<p>The people are so proud of having a church which bears so unusual a
proportion to the size of their village, that they will not allow it
was designed by any architect of less renown than Juan de Herrera, the
architect of the Escorial, whom another tradition declares to have had
a hand in the works at St. Peter&rsquo;s, in Rome.</p>
<p>Nor are they satisfied with the mere statement; they are also very
circumstantial in their account of his connexion with it, though both
are declared to be quite apocryphal. They say he was so pleased with
this work of his genius that he had it produced entirely under his own
eye. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>watched while the foundations were laid, while the
materials were collected round the spot, while every stone was laid in
its place; in fact, he was never tired of looking at it: now he would
take a long walk into the country to enjoy its appearance in the
distant view; now he would stand in the <i>plaza</i> beneath, and gaze
up at the storied decorations with which his fancy had invested it; now
he would mount the interior staircase of the tower, and look down from
the monument he had raised, upon the insignificant dwellings with which
it was surrounded.</p>
<p>On one of these latter expeditions he observed that he was one day
followed by Andres, his son, a boy of some fifteen years of age. The
circumstance pleased him, because he had noticed with growing sorrow
that Andres on many occasions had failed to display that fearless
disposition which is the characteristic of a brave and generous spirit.
Through an opening in the tracery he turned to watch, from a higher
stage, the boy&rsquo;s proceedings. For a certain distance he mounted
steadily enough, but in proportion as he got higher and had completed
more turnings, giddiness seemed to overcome him. Juan de Herrera began
to lose patience. The boy wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and
sat down in a recess. Herrera felt so provoked that he could not
restrain an impetuous movement; slight as was the attendant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>noise, it struck upon the boy&rsquo;s excited
nerves; he started from his resting-place, trembling like an aspen
leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Andres, my boy?&rdquo; cried his
father, to reassure him: &ldquo;it is only I, your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right!&rdquo; replied Andres, ashamed to be
caught under a display of weakness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on, boy; and don&rsquo;t sit panting like a
broken-winded horse. There, put your head out of that slit in the wall,
and look down and see what a fine height I have made this tower.
You&rsquo;ll see Dolores and Pepito and Luis and Mariquilla playing in
the <i>plaza</i>, and they will look like ants from this high
tower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andres somewhat recovered from his exertions and his alarm, and,
curious to see his playmates looking &ldquo;like ants,&rdquo; summoned
sufficient courage to put his head through the loophole.</p>
<p>For the first time the boy experienced the effect of the giddy
height; he hung back and turned pale, then pressed his hands against
the wall for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coward! you don&rsquo;t mean to say you are afraid!&rdquo;
exclaimed Juan de Herrera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;no&mdash;I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; stammered poor
Andres, making a convulsive effort to look out through the slit once
more.</p>
<p>This time he remained so long opposite the opening and so steadily,
that his father hoped he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>had got over the first fears; but,
watching him anxiously, he observed, as he at length turned away, that
he had his eyes closed.</p>
<p>Indignant that <i>his</i> son should not have as robust courage as
the peasant boys of the village, and still more that he should not be
in a condition to enjoy his favourite structure, Juan de Herrera,
unable to master his irritation, loaded the boy with reproaches; and
Andres slunk away, grieved at having distressed his father, yet unable
to summon courage sufficient to satisfy his wishes.</p>
<p>Some days after this, the consecration of the church took place, and
the municipal functionaries invited the architect and his son to a
banquet on the occasion, at which were assembled all the notabilities
of the place, as well as many from neighbouring villages, and even from
Madrid. Juan de Herrera deemed, with more zeal than judgment, that this
would be a favourable opportunity for curing his son of his weakness,
and to effect this narrated to the company the circumstance stated
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, it was a passing folly,&rdquo; cried the boy, burning
with shame; &ldquo;give me an opportunity, and I will show you that I
do not deserve your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, for the boy spoke with such thrilling earnestness
that the smile of derision which had been raised at his expense died
away from every lip. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93"
name="pb93">93</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i lang="es">galera</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1756src" href="#xd21e1756" name="xd21e1756src">1</a> has just
brought down the cross and ball for the summit of the steeple,&rdquo;
continued Andres; &ldquo;let me go up and place it, and I shall have
had the merit of crowning your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never dare it!&rdquo; answered Juan de Herrera
contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me show you I am not so bad,&rdquo; pleaded Andres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear in mind, boy, that if your courage fails when you get to
<i>that</i> height it will cost you your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; my courage will not be wanting,&rdquo;
replied Andres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so then,&rdquo; rejoined Juan de Herrera;
&ldquo;to-morrow you shall show what you are worth,&rdquo; and he
clasped the boy&rsquo;s hand to encourage him in his courageous
resolution, and all round the table applauded his pluck.</p>
<p>The next morning found all who were at the banquet, and many more
whose curiosity the report of the story had excited, gathered in the
<i>plaza</i> round the Church of Cove&ntilde;a. There at the foot of
the steeple lay shining the huge cross and ball, newly clad with
gilding and bound with strong ropes, by means of which it was to be
hoisted over the ready adjusted pulleys into its place. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t feel up to the mark, you had better give
in, even now!&rdquo; whispered Juan de Herrera, under the porch.
&ldquo;It is still time; and, mind, it is no easy task!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head is quite steady,&rdquo; answered Andres, piqued to
find his father still doubted his daring; and, his head erect, without
waiting to hear another word of warning, he commenced the ascent of the
spiral stair at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Not altogether free from uneasiness, Juan de Herrera went out to
watch the result from the stone cross in the centre of the
<i>plaza</i>. The whole crowd was nearly as breathless and anxious as
the father, but before two minutes had elapsed Andres was seen emerging
from behind one of the pinnacles of a platform, level with the beam on
which the bell had been hung a few days before.</p>
<p>A shudder seized the throng, for some one whispered that he had
heard the bell sound as the youth passed by, and the rest took up the
words and repeated under their breath with superstitious terror,
&ldquo;<i lang="es">La campana ha tocado &aacute; muerto</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1792src" href="#xd21e1792" name=
"xd21e1792src">2</a>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herrera, meantime, stood leaning against the cross a little way from
the crowd, and too much absorbed to catch the report. He seemed quite
tranquil and had heard no sound.</p>
<p>Most probably the lad had touched the clapper as he passed it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meantime Andres was steadily mounting a step-ladder placed on the
roof by which the final stage was to be reached, and from the steps was
engaged in arranging the support that was to receive the ball.</p>
<p>The workmen below were drawing the pulleys, and the ornament had
nearly reached the summit; as it rose, Andres had to mount two steps
more. He raised his foot, but his courage failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son is lost, for he hesitates!&rdquo; cried the
terror-stricken father, in a hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The multitude took up the cry; but, simultaneously with its
utterance, the luckless boy was precipitated to the ground, dashing
against one of the buttresses as he fell.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Juan de Herrera, adds the tradition, was never seen to smile
again.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>One day he went up to the top of the lantern of St. Lorenzo of the
Escorial, and gazed over towards Cove&ntilde;a. It seemed to him that
he saw two fiery eyes glaring upon him from the steeple which had once
been his pride.</p>
<p>Eight days after he was found a corpse. It was the anniversary of
the death of his son. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"

<h2 class="main">ANOTHER FAIR MAID OF ZARAGOZA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The title of the courageous maid who helped to defend
the walls of her native Zaragoza against the assault of the French
invaders, has already become a household word among us. The troubles of
the early part of Queen Isabella&rsquo;s reign elicited another
instance of feminine constancy, which has likewise received its tribute
of local celebration, though exhibited in a more confined and womanly
sphere.</p>
<p>Two sisters, Jacinta and Isabella, lived in Zaragoza with their
brother, Don Froilan. Among their acquaintance were two intimate
friends, Don Pablo and Don Matias, who both held commissions in the
National Militia. Don Matias was a handsome, generous young man, and a
general favourite, but also somewhat light-hearted and unscrupulous.
Don Pablo, on the other hand, was of a more solid, thoughtful
character, rather respected after long acquaintance than liked at first
sight. Now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>the characters of the two sisters, Jacinta and
Isabella, were very much like those of their two friends; Jacinta being
light and thoughtless, and Isabella steady and reflective; yet in spite
of this, Don Pablo was more fascinated by Jacinta&rsquo;s brilliant
qualities than by Isabella&rsquo;s good and careful ways; while
Isabella&rsquo;s good sense had taught her to prefer such a character
as Don Pablo&rsquo;s. And it was with a bleeding heart she saw it
agreed between him and her giddy sister that they were to be united for
ever. Her sisterly affection, however, forbid her to do more than sigh
in secret, and sigh she did many a day; not only for her own loss, but
for Don Pablo, whom she sincerely respected. For her light-hearted
sister, in spite of her engagement to him, used to continue to be very
merry with Don Matias too.</p>
<p>Just before the day appointed for the wedding, an <i lang=
"fr">&eacute;meute</i> broke out at some little distance, and the
Zaragoza Militia was ordered out to quell the disturbance. The world of
Zaragoza turned out to see the military array; and Don Froilan took his
sisters on to the Cosa<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1834src" href=
"#xd21e1834" name="xd21e1834src">1</a>, along with the rest; and while
Jacinta chatted merrily with both Don Pablo and Don Matias, as if they
were going out to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98"
name="pb98">98</a>]</span>a review instead of to fight, Isabella,
impressed with the danger of the situation, and the chance of never
seeing her dear friend again, could hardly bring herself to bid them
adieu.</p>
<p>Time passed on, and no certain tidings came of the fate of the two
officers. Every day there were conflicting reports, but nothing
reliable as to individual results.</p>
<p>At last a day came when the Zaragoza regiment returned, covered with
laurels and with hardly any losses from its ranks.</p>
<p>The Cosa was thronged with people welcoming the safe return of their
fellow townsmen. Jacinta was soon in earnest conversation with Don
Matias, while Isabella leant against a tree for support, as her gazing
eyes vainly sought Don Pablo.</p>
<p>Soon the truth was learnt from Don Matias. After waiting about in
the cover of houses and trees and hillocks for the insurgents for some
time, they had come to an open engagement with them, in which they were
in a short time entirely routed by the gallant Militia, who came off
with only two killed and half a dozen wounded&mdash;but one of those
two left for dead on the field was no other than Don Pablo! It needed
all Isabella&rsquo;s fortitude and self-command to avoid showing
greater agony at this announcement than was consistent with her having
no nearer tie than that of an intended sister-in-law, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>while
Jacinta, who had no self-control, burst into a fearful excitement of
grief.</p>
<p>Taking Isabella&rsquo;s assumed calmness of manner for indifference
towards the absent, the young officer within a few hours of his return
began paying her attentions. Jacinta&rsquo;s jealousy at this quenched
all her light grief for Don Pablo, and Don Matias soon found that his
suit would have far more chance of fortune with <i>her</i>. With
characteristic fickleness he lost no time in urging it in the quarter
where it met with favour, and pushed it so warmly that their marriage
was fixed for an early day, being but a month from that on which Don
Pablo was believed to have fallen.</p>
<p>To faithful Isabella&rsquo;s intense disgust, not only was the
wedding so hurried on, but all Zaragoza was invited to a grand ball to
celebrate the occasion. Dressed in deep mourning she refused to have
any thing to do with the festivity; but, on the contrary, ordered a
funeral service to be celebrated in the church to the memory of her
lost hero.</p>
<p>It was just at this juncture, while the music of the
marriage-ball<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1861src" href="#xd21e1861"
name="xd21e1861src">2</a> was sounding merrily through the open windows
of Don Froilan&rsquo;s house, and the solemn <i lang=
"es">doble</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1866src" href="#xd21e1866"
name="xd21e1866src">3</a> was ringing from a neighbouring church, that
Don Pablo, healed of his wounds, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>choosing the cool of
the evening for his journey, came through the streets of Zaragoza, well
wrapt up in his military cloak, intending to make straight for the
house of his affianced bride. He stopped, however, at the
<i>barbiere&rsquo;s</i> to have his hair and beard, long neglected
during the campaign, made presentable. The <i lang="es">barbiere</i> is
an institution in Spain which almost supplies the place of an English
club. Men go in to submit to the barber&rsquo;s attentions, and while
they are under his hands, or waiting their turn, they have leisure to
discuss with each other the news and gossip of the day.</p>
<p>Don Pablo was, as we have said, a serious man; his habits were
reserved and homely, he had never cared for the barber&rsquo;s gossip,
and his habit had been to manage his shaving arrangements at home, so
he was no acquaintance of the barber. Accordingly, he came in on this
occasion unrecognized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange are the vicissitudes of human life!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, as he seated himself in the barber&rsquo;s chair&mdash;for
he was somewhat of a philosopher. &ldquo;Marriage-music and
funeral-bells sounding at the same time&mdash;what a strange
lesson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger still,&rdquo; broke in the prattling barber,
&ldquo;if your worship knew what reference each bears to the same
person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the same person!&rdquo; rejoined Don Pablo; &ldquo;how can
that possibly be?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the bells are for a funeral service for a distinguished
officer, lost in the late encounter; and the merry music is for the
marriage of his betrothed to a brother-officer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Pablo started as if he had been shot. The barber noticed his
emotion. &ldquo;Your worship doubtless knows the officer of whom I
speak,&rdquo; replied the barber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es, I do&mdash;o!&rdquo; stammered Don Pablo,
relieved to find the barber had not hit nearer the mark. &ldquo;You
speak of Don Pablo, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do!&rdquo; exclaimed the barber; &ldquo;no one
has spoken of any one else these last days. And here come some of his
friends round the corner; if you want to hear them speak of him you
have only to listen. I&rsquo;ll warrant he is the subject of their
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to hear what they say,&rdquo; said Don Pablo,
whose curiosity was strongly excited by these revelations about
himself; &ldquo;but it might embarrass them to see so near a friend to
him as I was, here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step to this unlighted window, and you will hear all without
being seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Pablo did as he was bid, and readily distinguished a group of
his acquaintances, with Don Froilan in their midst, standing at the
barber&rsquo;s door, lighting their cigars<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1901src" href="#xd21e1901" name="xd21e1901src">4</a>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, Don Froilan!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Lupercio; &ldquo;a
ball at your own house in honour of your sister&rsquo;s wedding, and
you out here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Ah, poor fellow!&rdquo; said Don Pablo to himself, &ldquo;he
won&rsquo;t countenance his sister&rsquo;s fickleness. He was always a
great friend of mine.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth,&rdquo; replied Don Froilan,
&ldquo;the first part of a ball is always dull work. I have set them
going, and I&rsquo;m off to the opera. I always enjoy the second act of
an opera; it&rsquo;s the cream of the whole. I shall just skim that
off, and then run back to the best of the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Don Pablo, sadly, &ldquo;this is the man I
have so often helped through his difficulties! And I really thought he
cared for me!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, really!&rdquo; said Don Mariano, &ldquo;I thought you
were going to say that you had come out to attend the funeral service
for your friend Don Pablo&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Ah, yes, that would have been more like a friend!&rdquo;
sighed Don Pablo.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;funeral service? no&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m not
fond of that sort of thing, it&rsquo;s so melancholy! And then
what&rsquo;s the use&mdash;if the fellow died, as I&rsquo;ve no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>doubt he did, without so much as saying an
&lsquo;Our Father,&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the use of praying for
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;The atrocious calumny!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Pablo;
&ldquo;and not one of them to say a word in my defence!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>An awkward pause ensued, which was broken by the gallant young Don
Antonio: &ldquo;And while we are wasting our time here, your sisters
are dancing away and charming every one, as usual!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Dancing away while the church bells are tolling for poor
me!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sisters&mdash;eh? No&mdash;o, not exactly; that is, only
one of them. Jacinta is dancing, of course; but
Isabella&mdash;a&mdash;won&rsquo;t&mdash;a&mdash;come in. I believe
she&rsquo;s gone to the church instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;So, indeed, there&rsquo;s one of them at least who
hasn&rsquo;t forgotten me! And one, too, whose remembrance is more
worth having than all the others&rsquo; put together!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied Don Lupercio; &ldquo;but I thought it
was the other sister who had been more attached to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attached? ah, yes&mdash;in one way; that is, she was engaged
to him; but as to attachment, that is, of the heart&mdash;between you
and me&mdash;it was Isabella who cared for him. Jacinta, you see, only
wanted to be married, and Don Matias will do just as well for
that&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t surprise me,&rdquo; responded young Don
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>Antonio, who generally knew which way the
ladies&rsquo; inclination turned. &ldquo;Something of this I suspected
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added Don Mariano.</p>
<p>(&ldquo;Fool that I was!&rdquo; growled Don Pablo; &ldquo;all these
butterflies saw it, and I never ventured to think of it! I looked on
her as a priestess, a goddess&mdash;I never ventured to think of her in
any other way. She was always so grand and grave; and Jacinta was so
accessible.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, good evening, gentlemen! I shall really miss the opera,
if I stand chatting any longer,&rdquo; broke in Don Froilan.</p>
<p>They dispersed: Don Froilan bending his steps towards the opera, and
the rest towards the ball-room. Meantime, sadly veiled in black, and
attended by Ramon, the old and trusty family-servant, Isabella crossed
the street, and entered the church as the last tolls were sounding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes to pray for me&mdash;it is true
enough!&mdash;while others are dancing!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Pablo,
rapturously. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll have my joke with Don Froilan
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barber!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;send me a notary, quick!
I&rsquo;ve some important business which must be transacted
instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the instant, your worship!&rdquo; replied the barber.
&ldquo;There is one lodging, luckily, in the sixth floor of this very
house.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ten minutes&rsquo; conference with the notary settled the affair.
Then he bid him run with the paper to Don Froilan&rsquo;s box at the
theatre<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1964src" href="#xd21e1964" name=
"xd21e1964src">5</a>, and took up his station again at the window, to
have the happiness of seeing Isabella once more as she came out of the
church, and also to take the chance of enjoying the effect of the paper
he had sent to Don Froilan. Nor did he wait long. In less time than he
would have thought possible, Don Froilan came running out of the opera,
hurrying to take his place at the funeral service, and give a public
token of his attention to the deceased. But the doors were closed, and
Don Pablo&rsquo;s thoughts were diverted from her brother by the sight
of Isabella, pale and haggard, her eyes worn with tears, coming out of
the church, leaning on Ramon&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! is it too late?&rdquo; cried Don Froilan, stumbling
against her on the steps in the dark. &ldquo;Oh dear, how hard! and I
made such haste to come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why this sudden haste, brother?&rdquo; replied Isabella,
contemptuously. &ldquo;This morning you chid me for disturbing the
ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, child! if I did it, it was to please Jacinta&mdash;it
was quite, quite against my own inclination. Oh, why wasn&rsquo;t I by
to assist him in his last moments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why all this sudden grief now?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sudden! it&rsquo;s not sudden; you know I always loved him as
a brother; and here&rsquo;s the proof of how well he loved me. A notary
has just brought me a will he left with him before he went to the war,
constituting me his heir to all he had, dear fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isabella pushed by him with a movement of disdain, which perfectly
delighted Don Pablo, and made her way mournfully into the house,
attended as before by Ramon.</p>
<p>Don Pablo lost little time in following her. Who could be proof
against so much constancy? If he had looked on her as an inaccessible
divinity before, he felt sufficient encouragement now to tell her that
he thought so.</p>
<p>The faithful Ramon was very ready to lend his assistance, and Don
Pablo having taken him into confidence he dexterously managed to break
the good news of his resurrection to his young mistress, who consented
to come down to the ball-room and confront her brother and sister on
Don Pablo&rsquo;s presenting himself there too. The consternation
caused by his appearance was of course very great. Some of the ladies
nearly fainted. Don Froilan guessed the trap he had fallen into, and
turned away to cover his shame as well as disappointment at the loss of
the inheritance. Jacinta and Matias hid their faces behind her fan;
while Isabella and Pablo joined their loving hands amid the joyful
congratulations of their assembled friends. <span class=

<h2 class="main">JUANITA THE BALD;<br>
OR,<br>
A DAUGHTER&rsquo;S LOVE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived once upon a time on the banks of the Tagus
a poor shepherd named Juan; and he was as honest as he was poor, and as
contented as he was honest. He had just enough wages to buy the coarse
meal which supported him and his hard-working wife, Consolacion. A
<i lang="es">zamarra</i>, or suit of rough sheepskin, which served to
keep out the cold for several years together, was afforded him from the
flock, and with weaving and knitting Consolacion provided the rest of
their scanty wardrobe.</p>
<p>Now Juan had a large flock confided to his care, and his master
reposed entire trust in him; but if he never had the provocation of
being looked after, neither had he ever the satisfaction of being
praised. Yet, notwithstanding this lack of all earthly stimulus, Juan
was always faithful to his trust: no sheep ever strayed that he did not
seek out over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>the barren waste and the steep mountain-side; no
little lamb was ever left by any sad accident without its dam, but he
brought it home to Consolacion, and the honest pair reared it as
tenderly as if it had been their own infant.</p>
<p>But if Juan&rsquo;s master neglected to commend his integrity, there
was One who did not forget him, but kept a just account of all his
actions. Thus it chanced one day, when after a long drought the herbage
was dried up, and he had had endless trouble in keeping his flock
together, as the poor things would wander hither and thither while
seeking pasture, that at last he got led away far from home, along a
wild path he had never trodden before, and the country all around him
looked strange, and yet there was the track of his runaway sheep before
him, and on and on he went. The way was sandy, and the sun was fierce,
and at last his strength failed him; footsore and dispirited he sank
down at the foot of a tree, whose shelter he vainly sought, as its
foliage had long been burnt up by the parching sun, and only the
bleached trunk and thirsty branches remained. Half maddened with thirst
and heat, he fell into a sort of trance, and he thought he saw an
ancient hermit of severe aspect standing before him, who chid him that
he lay there taking his rest while his master&rsquo;s sheep were
astray, calling him only a <i lang="es">zagal</i> (or shepherd&rsquo;s
helper). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>Juan did not lose his temper at the reprimand, but meekly begged
forgiveness, and endeavoured to rise that he might get him upon his way
again. His strength failed him, however, and he sank once more upon the
ground. Then, in the place of the hermit, he saw before him a beautiful
child with a shepherd&rsquo;s crook in his hand, and carrying a lamb in
his bosom, who told him to be comforted, for he had found his sheep,
and fed them, and led them safely home to the fold. He commended too
his faithful service, and told him that he was come to offer him a
reward, and gave him the choice of three. The first was a large sum of
money, with which he could go down to one of the rich seaports of Spain
and trade. The second was a grand castle in the mountains, where he
would have ease and luxury and plenty of retainers to do his bidding.
The third was to retain his present humble condition, while to his
hearth was added the presence of a gentle daughter.</p>
<p>Then honest Juan did not hesitate which to choose. &ldquo;Give me
not money,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for money begets covetousness, and
<i lang="es">codicia rompe el saco</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2013src" href="#xd21e2013" name="xd21e2013src">1</a>. Give me not
power, for I was not born to it, and the proverb of our forefathers
says, A fallen rich man may make a good master, but not an enriched
poor man (<i lang="es">Sierve &aacute; un rico empobrecido y no
&aacute; un pobre enriquecido</i>). But give me&mdash;oh, give me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>a child to love me in my old age! I am but a
poor, worthless servant to ask this thing&mdash;nevertheless, it is the
bounty of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Juan woke to consciousness, the great heat of the day had
passed away, and his shaggy dog was licking his face, as if to warn him
that he had but little time to get home before dark. Trusting to the
animal&rsquo;s sagacity for guidance, he soon found his way home, where
the sheep were safely folded, as the beautiful shepherd-child had
promised, and Consolacion was waiting on the threshold of the hut, to
welcome him home to supper.</p>
<p>To his other virtues Juan added humility, and, indeed, without it
they would have been of little value; and it seemed so much like vanity
to talk of his vision that he never mentioned a word of it, till it
slipped off his tongue unawares years after. Nevertheless, before a
twelvemonth was out, a dear little baby was found in
Consolacion&rsquo;s arms, completing their simple happiness.</p>
<p>Juanita (little Janey)&mdash;so they called her&mdash;was beautiful
as a child of promise should be, but her chief glory was the rich
profusion of waving hair which covered her like a veil, and rested
gracefully on the ground as she knelt in prayer. She grew up the joy of
her parents, and being very docile soon learnt all the domestic arts of
her mother, and was never so happy as when she was relieving her of her
household cares. If they had any thing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>to complain of with
her it was that she had quite a passion for admiring her beautiful
hair; and when she was sent to the fountain she would sometimes waste
hours looking at herself, and arranging it according to various
fancies. But when her mother looked grave on her return, it was quite
sufficient to keep her from offending so again for many days.</p>
<p>Thus many years of tranquil, homely joy passed away. Peace and
gladness is not of long continuance in this world for the good, and
Juan&rsquo;s time of trouble was at hand. First, it pleased Providence
to take Consolacion to Himself; then, as a result of much weeping over
her, and his great privations and long exposure to sun and weather, his
eyes grew dim, and then his sight failed him entirely. Then the old
dog, by whose help he still managed to keep the sheep together, in
spite of his blindness, died too; and he was of no use any longer as a
shepherd, and he had nothing left to him but Juanita. Juanita, it is
true, fulfilled all a daughter&rsquo;s part, and by her industry
supported him above actual want.</p>
<p>But her little head was always running on how his sight could be
regained; and one day she revealed the result of her cogitations.
&ldquo;Father dear, do not all the wise people live in great cities?
Let us now get us down to prosperous Segovia, or noble Toledo, or
beautiful Sevilla, and let us find <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>some of the cunning men to
heal of whom we have heard, and get you back your sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Juan lacked the courage to undertake so great a journey and
expose his little daughter to all the attendant risks by the way; and
he was a man of great patience to endure what the Lord sent; and so
they remained in the mountain-hut for five years more. By that time
Juanita was fifteen, and quite a little woman, and her advice began to
have the weight of a woman&rsquo;s authority with her father, and at
last she got him to consent to her often-urged prayer that they should
journey to seek a doctor.</p>
<p>Juanita&rsquo;s ears had been ever open to learn every story of
healing from every traveller who chanced to pass their cot, and in this
way she had learnt the fame of a certain Jew mediciner, who dwelt at
Toledo, and to Toledo therefore she was bent on directing their
steps.</p>
<p>A beautiful sight it was to see the venerable old man leaning his
hand, withered with honest labour, on the silken tresses of his
courageous child. The way was long, but there was no lack of
hospitality; the admiration of the peasants they passed was every where
kindled by Juan&rsquo;s patience and Juanita&rsquo;s devotion, and a
bite and a sup never failed them. At last they came to Toledo; and in a
great city it was not so easy to find shelter, but God warmed to them
the heart of an old woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>who had herself suffered and
learnt compassion by suffering; she gave them a bed, and
Juanita&rsquo;s busy fingers, before long, provided means of
subsistence.</p>
<p>Her next care was to make out the Hebrew doctor, which was not of
the easiest, as those of his race were scarcely tolerated, and did not
care to make themselves ostensible. However, a daughter&rsquo;s love
overcomes all obstacles, and at last she found the means to bring her
father before the wise man. Imagine her joy, when after all her
labours, he pronounces with confidence that he <i>can</i> restore her
father&rsquo;s sight! For a moment of joy, a twelve-month of anxiety,
however. In another minute she has learnt that he demands 500 maravedis
for the cure!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abate something for charity? What! charity to a dog of a
Christian! Why, it was enough that he soiled his fingers with healing
him, but to forego his pitiful fee too,&mdash;never! by the Holy City,
never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juanita could speak no word more for tears. In silence she placed
her father&rsquo;s hand on her glittering hair, and in sadness guided
his weak footsteps back to their poor shelter.</p>
<p>Hard work it had been to provide subsistence for them both, and to
make a little extra to have something to offer to the lone widow, who
had taken them in&mdash;but how hope ever to make up 500 <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>maravedis? If in the first days of their arrival
she had wasted some precious hours over her old favourite pastime of
arranging her luxuriant tresses, and had taken pleasure when people
called out in admiration&mdash;all that was gone by now. She sat at her
little loom, work, work, work!&mdash;she never took her hands off,
never lifted her eyes, never even saw that the barber who lived
opposite was constantly gazing upon her. The only thing to cheer her
was the placid voice of Juan, who would continually bid her be of good
comfort and put her trust in God.</p>
<p>One day, in the midst of her toil, there came a messenger from the
Corregidor of the city. His aunt had died that day, and as she died
unmarried, a procession of girls equal in number to the years of her
life must follow her to the grave, draped in white. She numbered eighty
years, and Juanita was required to make up the eightieth attendant.
Juanita could not say &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; even though it cost her such
precious hours.</p>
<p>When she came into the hall where the mourners were assembled she
found to her no slight disgust that the dress she had to wear consisted
in part of a great white hood. It was hard, on the only day she
suffered herself to part from her work, to have to cover up her
glorious hair! At all events, till the procession began to move she
would throw it back. She did so, and it made her look the picture
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>of an angel, as it fell in rich curls over the
white dress. At the same moment the Corregidor&rsquo;s wife passed
through the hall. Though younger than her defunct sister-in-law she had
arrived at that age when nature sometimes thinks it right to withdraw
her gift of hair, and sorely did she lament the loss. For a long time
past she had left an order with a clever barber of the city to
manufacture her a wig which should make good the defect, and he was to
swear it was no dead person&rsquo;s hair. She had a superstition that
in wearing the hair of a dead person, you assumed the responsibility of
all their sins, and, the good lady being sufficiently satisfied with
her own position in the scale of grace, had no desire to run the risk
of getting a worse one, even for the sake of the coveted wig. But a wig
made of the hair of a living person was not an order easy to execute.
The moment her eyes fell on Juanita&rsquo;s magnificent <i lang=
"es">cabellera</i> (head of hair) she determined that it should not be
long before it should decorate her own head.</p>
<p>Accordingly, she hastened to call the Corregidor aside and assure
him he must procure it for her. The Corregidor knowing the attachment a
maiden was likely to have for such an adornment, endeavoured to
convince her of the impossibility of the task. All was of no use, save
to render her more resolute. The Corregidor knew that in disputes with
his wife he always had to give in at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>last, and so, to
pacify her, promised he would do his best, and to satisfy her that he
did so the interview was arranged to take place in her presence.</p>
<p>The funeral was no sooner over than the Corregidor beckoned Juanita
to follow him into his wife&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Poor little Juanita never thought of resisting an order from so
great a functionary, but tripped along lightly behind him.</p>
<p>What was her surprise to find herself severely chid for wasting the
time she might spend in working for her father in the vanity of decking
out her hair! Juanita did not grow angry, or deny her fault, but could
not forbear asking, with great simplicity, &ldquo;Was it her fault if
God had given her a great mass of hair to comb out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not your fault at all, my dear child,&rdquo; said the
Corregidor, much relieved to find she took his admonitions so meekly.
&ldquo;Not your fault at all, so long as you keep it on your head; but
you might cut it all off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it off!&rdquo; repeated poor Juanita, mechanically;
&ldquo;what would be the use of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you might sell it, child. I myself would give you fifty
maravedis for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me fifty maravedis for it!&rdquo; exclaimed the child,
wondering what he could possibly want it for.</p>
<p>The Corregidor, fancying her surprise was dictated by indignation at
the smallness of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>offer, and incited by a gesture from his
wife, impatient lest she should lose the prize, hastened to reply,
&ldquo;Well, if that does not content you, I&rsquo;ll give you 100
maravedis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Juanita&rsquo;s astonishment only increased; so she stared at
him instead of answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d even say 150,&rdquo; continued the Corregidor.</p>
<p>But Juanita only looked the more surprised. And so they went on, his
anxiety bidding against her bewilderment, till at last he got up to 500
maravedis!</p>
<p>&ldquo;500 maravedis!&rdquo; echoed the child, as if waking from a
trance at the words which brought back to memory the fee required to
restore her father&rsquo;s sight. &ldquo;Oh, yes! give me 500
maravedis, it is all yours at <i>that</i>!&rdquo; And then the thought
of her great loss made her burst into a flood of tears. It was a
thought which for a moment almost overpowered her strong sense of
filial piety, and in the depth of her little heart she half wished the
Corregidor would repent of his bargain. But no such luck; at her first
sign of yielding the lady had run off to fetch her largest scissors,
and in a trice she had begun shearing at the glittering spoil. Down the
bright silken masses fell on the snowy drapery, and beside them fell
the child&rsquo;s pearly tears over her lost treasure. At last the
sacrifice was complete; and poor Juanita stood in the midst of the ruin
more dead than alive. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Corregidor counted into her lap the promised sum, and the
reckoning once more woke a sensation of joy. Wrapping her hood close
round her, Juanita lost not a moment in flying to conduct her father to
the house of the Jew.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were now entirely fixed on the moment of his
restoration, but even this thought was embittered by the reflection
that his one reason for desiring to have his sight back was to look on
her&mdash;and she was no longer what she had been!</p>
<p>The strange alteration in her appearance soon got whispered about
among the neighbours; and she got so much stared at that she never
ventured into the street but when forced by sheer necessity, and then
she ran along, looking neither to the right hand nor the left, and not
even perceiving how considerately her opposite neighbour the barber
followed her steps, and defended her from the rudeness of the street
boys.</p>
<p>At last her father&rsquo;s tedious cure was completed, and she was
admitted to see him. Some one had, unperceived by her, followed her
respectfully all the way, ready to protect her at all hazards. In the
<i lang="es">zaguan</i> (sort of vestibule) of the Jew&rsquo;s house
this faithful follower confronted her, and she recognized the gallant
barber at once. Gently pushing back her hood he substituted another
covering for her head. Juanita put up her hand, and, to her surprise,
found it tangled in the masses of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119"
href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>her own rich hair! She
stroked it with both hands, and found it all there, just as if by
enchantment. Finding her dumb with astonishment, the barber hastened to
explain that the wife of the Corregidor having sent the hair to him to
make up, he had resolved no one should wear it but herself, and for the
Corregidora he had put together the best match he could from the store
he kept by him for such purposes. They were now interrupted by a
summons from the Jew, who was ready to remove Juan&rsquo;s bandages.
They no sooner reached the room where he was, than he ran and clasped
Juanita in his arms, exclaiming, &ldquo;God be praised that I can see
you, my child&mdash;a few years&rsquo; blindness are well repaid when
it is reserved to one to see such a daughter as you!&rdquo; Then,
perceiving the barber, he embraced him too, and said, &ldquo;God be
praised for my sight! since I can now work for my living again, and
repay you, my benefactor, for well I know, though I would never tell
Juanita to increase her burden, that it is you who have paid the rent
of our lodging all this time! My son, my dear son, what can I do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing, father, you can do for me&mdash;one only
thing, but it is too great to ask!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is too great to-day&mdash;ask away, boy, never
fear!&rdquo; The barber looked towards Juanita to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>gain
courage, and, seeing her approving smile, fell on his knees and begged
Juan to let him marry her. &ldquo;With all my heart, if the wench so
will,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;I cannot see her wedded to an
honester fellow!&rdquo; Juan was not slow to read in her eyes what her
sentiments were, and so, without more ado, he took the hand of each to
place them in one another. But both drew back. The barber, with all his
charity and delicacy and taste, was very ugly, and he could not believe
in his good fortune; and Juanita had one condition to lay down first.
&ldquo;How now! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;Come,
friend barber, explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I think it is but fair to give Juanita time to
consider it all. I know I&rsquo;m not so good-looking as <i>her</i>
husband ought to be. Long ago should I have told her how I loved her
but for this&mdash;but I dared not! I longed to offer the 500 maravedis
over and over again, but I dared not speak to her; and now the joy is
all so strange I feel I must not hurry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well spoken, young man! but, Juanita, what do <i>you</i> hang
back for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have one little condition to make;&rdquo; and she
turned to the barber. &ldquo;I have been thinking that we have not
acted quite honestly with the Corregidora. She has a superstition
against wearing dead people&rsquo;s hair, and she has paid honourably
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>for that of a living person&mdash;so what she
has bought must be taken back to her. Moreover, I recognize that all my
life this hair has been a snare to me, and whenever I have been led
from the path of duty it has been by its means&mdash;so I am resolved
never to wear it again, and to be known in future by no other name but
that of <span class="sc">Juanita the Bald</span>! What say you, are you
content to marry me <i>now</i>?&rdquo; The honest barber&mdash;perhaps
on the whole not very sorry for a stipulation which put them somewhat
nearer on a condition of equality in regard to personal
appearance&mdash;only answered by clasping her in his embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! what is all this,&rdquo; fell in the old man,
&ldquo;about hair and the Corregidora, and Juanita the&mdash;the
<i>Bald</i>!&mdash;eh?&rdquo; Then the barber was obliged to explain to
him the sacrifice Juanita had made, first to obtain his cure, and again
to her sense of honour, and her delicacy of conscience. The old man was
quite unnerved by the recital. At first he was determined to resist her
resolution; but his own mind was too well regulated not to acknowledge
on reflection that she had chosen the good part.</p>
<p>Then, after blessing solemnly, both her and her betrothed, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Did I not choose rightly from among the three
gifts?&rdquo; (in his humility he would not say <i>rewards</i>).
&ldquo;If I had chosen riches, they would have burst the bag and run
away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>And if I had chosen power, my retainers would
have mocked my want of knowledge, and forsaken me. But a
daughter&rsquo;s love&mdash;what can compare with it?&rdquo;

<h2 class="main">STARVING JOHN THE DOCTOR.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No one was ever more appropriately named than
&lsquo;Starving John.&rsquo; He had nothing to live upon, yet he had a
wife and a whole tribe of children to support: how to feed them all he
knew not; and as for himself it was seldom enough he got a morsel to
eat!</p>
<p>One day the cat caught a hare, and John&rsquo;s wife managed to take
it from him; and having made a savoury mess of it, she put it into a
wallet and said to John, &ldquo;Here, take this <i lang=
"es">hato</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2163src" href="#xd21e2163"
name="xd21e2163src">1</a>; it&rsquo;s a lucky taste of something nice,
such as you don&rsquo;t often get; and go out into the fields with it
before those sharks of children snatch it out of your mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John, who was ready to die of hunger, didn&rsquo;t wait to be told
twice, but set off running as fast as his legs would carry him. At last
he came to an olive-grove; and there, making an easy-chair of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>hollow olive-tree, he sat down to eat his hare,
as happy as a king.</p>
<p>Somehow however&mdash;he could never tell how&mdash;there suddenly
stood before him a dreadful old woman, all dressed in black: she had
sunken eyes as dull as a blown-out candle, or a lamp-wick when the oil
fails; her skin was as withered and yellow as a Simancas<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2174src" href="#xd21e2174" name="xd21e2174src">2</a>
parchment; her mouth like a clothes-basket; and her nose I don&rsquo;t
know how to describe&mdash;for she had no nose at all to speak of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty figure this to fall from heaven, like God&rsquo;s
rain, on a poor fellow!&rdquo; said John to himself; but as he was
polite and hospitable, as a Spanish peasant always is, he nevertheless
asked if she would share his meal.</p>
<p>This was just what the old creature wanted; down she sat, and at
once attacked the hare. But it was not like ordinary eating, it was
regular devouring; and, <i lang="es">en un decir tilin</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2183src" href="#xd21e2183" name=
"xd21e2183src">3</a>, she had stowed away the whole mess between her
heart and her shoulders! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>John was too polite to grumble out aloud, but he said to himself,
&ldquo;Why, the children had better have had the hare than this old
hag! but <i lang="es">&iexcl;el que tiene mala fortuna nada le sale
derecho<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2194src" href="#xd21e2194" name=
"xd21e2194src">4</a>!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his visitor had finished her meal&mdash;not leaving so much as
the tail of the hare in the <i lang="es">ollita</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2202src" href="#xd21e2202" name="xd21e2202src">5</a>&mdash;she
exclaimed, &ldquo;Do you know, John, your hare was very
good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; said John, who could not repress a little
bitterness. And he added, ironically, in honour of her decrepit
appearance, &ldquo;<i lang="es">&iexcl;viva Usted mil
a&ntilde;os<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2209src" href="#xd21e2209" name=
"xd21e2209src">6</a>!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I shall,&rdquo; answered the hag; &ldquo;I have lived many
thousands already, for I have to tell you I am no less a person than
<span class="sc">Death</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John gave a start, and was like one struck dumb at this
announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, John,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to hurt you; and what is more, as you have treated me
so well, I&rsquo;ll give you a good counsel in return. Make yourself a
doctor&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like it for making money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you, Mistress Death,&rdquo; answered
John, very respectfully, &ldquo;but it will be quite return enough, if
you&rsquo;ll promise to leave me <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126"
href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>alone for a good number of
years. As to being a doctor, I&rsquo;ve no notion how to set about it.
I know neither Latin nor Greek; I can&rsquo;t write because my hand is
palsied; and I can&rsquo;t read because I hate poring over those little
black figures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go along with you, you silly fellow!&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Death; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t suppose any of this is necessary?
It&rsquo;s I who lead the doctors, not they me. You are not such a
goose as to think I go and come because they hiss me or call me, are
you? when I get tired of any one, I take him by the ear and drag him
off, doctor or no doctor. When the world began there were no doctors,
and men lived to a good old age. But since they invented doctors there
have been no more Methuselahs! You make yourself a doctor, as I advise
you; and if you are perverse and obstinate, I&rsquo;ll carry you off
with me, <i lang="es">mas fijo que el reloj</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2231src" href="#xd21e2231" name="xd21e2231src">7</a>! Don&rsquo;t
prate!&rdquo; she added, as she saw he was going to urge some
objection; &ldquo;this is all you have to do&mdash;when they call you
into a bed-room look out for me. If you see me standing at the head of
the bed, you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s all up&mdash;you have only to say
so, and they&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;re a wise prophet. If, on the
other hand, you don&rsquo;t see me, you have only to prescribe a dose
of clean water, with any thing harmless you like in it, and the sick
person will recover.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>With that the ugly old lady took herself off, courtesying like a
French dancing-mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your worship won&rsquo;t forget, Mistress Death, what
I asked you!&rdquo; John cried after her&mdash;&ldquo;your worship
won&rsquo;t visit me again for a long time to come, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, John,&rdquo; she answered, as she
disappeared, &ldquo;until your house crumbles to pieces you won&rsquo;t
have a visit from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John returned home to his wife, and told her all that had happened;
and his wife, being sharper than he, determined to make use of Mrs.
Death&rsquo;s advice, and in spite of his remonstrances spread about
every where the news that her husband was a famous doctor&mdash;that he
had only to look at a patient to tell whether he would live or die.</p>
<p>All the neighbours, however, only laughed at the idea of Starving
John turning doctor in his old age, and called him &ldquo;Don
John&rdquo; in ridicule.</p>
<p>One Sunday they went so far as to arrange a practical joke to show
off his ignorance. A number of girls were to sit round a basket of
figs, as they often did of a holiday afternoon in the fruit season,
when, all of a sudden, one of them was to give a terrible cry as if
taken ill, and some of the others were to carry her off to bed, while
the rest ran for Starving John the Doctor.</p>
<p>John had no great faith in Mrs. Death&rsquo;s promises, and was
loath to expose himself to the ridicule of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>girls, but at his wife&rsquo;s urging he went
along with them, when, lo and behold, he no sooner entered the room of
the pretended patient, than he saw Mrs. Death herself standing at the
head of the bed! &ldquo;The girl is very ill indeed&mdash;too ill for
me to save. She&rsquo;ll die before night!&rdquo; pronounced John, in a
knowing tone. And he went home amid the laughter of the assembled
neighbours, who knew what the girls were playing at. But it so happened
that the unfortunate girl had been eating the fruit too
freely&mdash;that she was taken ill and died that very night!</p>
<p>As you will readily guess, this made Starving John&rsquo;s
fortune.</p>
<p>Far or near, there was no patient slightly or dangerously ill to
whom he was not called; fees flowed in like rain. No longer was he
dressed in rags; his clothes were properly made by a tailor. Instead of
his pinched, woebegone look, his face grew as ruddy as the sun; his
withered hands, as smooth as pork-sausages; his shaking legs, as firm
as marble columns; and his empty stomach assumed dimensions to vie with
the dome of a church. For his children he bought honourable
employments, and badges of office to sew on in front, and keys<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2259src" href="#xd21e2259" name="xd21e2259src">8</a>
to hang out behind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>But what he spared least of all was the money required to keep his
house in good repair. He even salaried a bricklayer, whose business it
was to see there was never so much as a tile loose, remembering that
Mrs. Death had said she would never come to visit him till his house
crumbled to pieces.</p>
<p>Years rolled by as John&rsquo;s fortune increased, but as prosperous
years always roll away&mdash;fast; and then came less fortunate years.
First his hair fell off, and then he lost his teeth; then his spine got
curved like a reaping-hook; and then he grew halt in one of his legs.
One day, when he was ill, Mrs. Death sent him a bat, with her
compliments, to inquire after him; but John didn&rsquo;t like the look
of the creature, and drove it away. After that he had a cough; and Mrs.
Death sent an owl, to say she would come and see him very soon, and
John drove him away too. After that he had a fit; and Mrs. Death sent a
dog, to give him to understand, by howling at his door, that she was on
her way, and John drove him away also. But he got ill for all that, and
then he got worse, and then Mrs. Death knocked at the door, so John
hobbled out of bed, and locked it and put up the bar; but Death
contrived to creep in under the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Death!&rdquo; said John, indignantly, &ldquo;this
isn&rsquo;t fair. You told me you wouldn&rsquo;t come so long as my
house was not crumbling to pieces.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; answered Death, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t your body your
house&mdash;and hasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> been crumbling to pieces?
Didn&rsquo;t your strength fail first, and then your hair, and then
your teeth, and then your limbs; haven&rsquo;t they <i>all</i> been
crumbling away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly didn&rsquo;t understand you so!&rdquo; answered
John, dolefully, &ldquo;and relying on your word, your coming now takes
me by surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is <i>your</i> fault, John,&rdquo; answered Death.
&ldquo;Men ought to be always prepared for my coming, and then I should
never take them by surprise.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">RAMON THE DISCONTENTED.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ramon was a discontented man. Instead of thanking
Providence for all the good gifts of earth, and the promise of the joys
of heaven, he was always repining at the hardships of his life, and
finding out one thing after another to grumble at. Work he specially
objected to. He wanted a cottage, and a pig, and a stock of poultry,
and a vine, and a wife, a smoking <i lang="es">cazuela</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2294src" href="#xd21e2294" name=
"xd21e2294src">1</a>, and plenty of tobacco; but when it came to
working to pay for them, then it was quite another story. He was an
only son; his hard-working parents had spoilt him by letting him have
his own way, supplying him with all he wanted out of their own
earnings; and so he grew up idle and apathetic, finding fault with
fate, instead of putting his shoulder to the wheel: &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Estan las cosas en este mundo como cuernos en un
costal&mdash;todas de punta</i>&rdquo; was a favourite proverb of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>his, meaning that the events of this life are
like packing horns into a bag, the points of those first put in are
always making their way through and obstructing the others. And indeed,
if people indulge a discontented disposition, every thing must go wrong
with them.</p>
<p>Strange, that any one can find pleasure in such an ugly habit as
grumbling. Ramon had been made by nature a good-looking boy; but a
sour, gloomy expression soon superseded the engaging smile of youth;
and as he had never a pleasant word, his society was gradually shunned
by all the village. The last to give him up was Carmen, the bright
little playmate of his childhood, but he wore out even <i>her</i>
patience, and then, when he was left to himself, he grew more and more
sour and morose.</p>
<p>In the meantime, his good old father and mother had died, and for a
time he had been living on the savings they had left him; but this was
soon at an end, and hunger forced home the reflection, &ldquo;What was
to become of him?&rdquo; Then every thing seemed gloomier than ever
before even&mdash;he sat down to think under the old patriarchal vine,
which had shaded his father, and his grandfather, and his
great-grandfather before him; but the fierce sun came through the
withered branches and maddened him. He had neglected to tend it, and it
had no shelter for <i>him</i>. Instead of blaming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>his
own neglect, he turned with an imprecation upon the vine, and his
ill-humour overflowed on to the old house, against the wall of which he
leant and which was also crumbling to decay because he had left it
without repair; and upon Carmen, whose patience he had wearied, and
upon fortune, whose gifts he had left waste. And in his fury he said
that he would die. &ldquo;Die!&rdquo; echoed a little leaf of the
withered vine, as it fell rustling past him, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t die
when you will, you must fulfil the work God has set you, whatever it
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work! I will do no work. I will die!&rdquo; he answered
fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot die when you will!&rdquo; whispered another
rustling leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see!&rdquo; said Ramon; and with that he took up the
rope of the well, and, stalking wildly upstairs, he deliberately made a
noose, into which he inserted his throat, tied one end over a beam in
the loft, and placed himself on an old chest, ready to jump off and so
swing tight the fatal knot which was to end his days.</p>
<p>He shut his eyes, and took a desperate leap ... but ... instead of
drawing the noose tight, the beam above broke in twain, and the two
ends came with him to the ground. He had scarcely recovered from one
surprise, when he had to encounter another. On each side of him a
stream of golden coins came running through the broken ends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>of the hollowed beam. What a sight for a lazy,
self-indulgent man! Ramon thought no more of hanging now. He untied the
knot, gathered up the gold, and secured it in chests and hiding-places,
and came down to enjoy himself once more in his old idle way.</p>
<p>He trod on a dry leaf of the old vine, as he passed through the
garden, and it whispered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a chance for you, Ramon! Buy yourself a patch of land,
and set to work like a man, and show Carmen you are worthy of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work! while I have gold enough to last for ever? Not I,
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t last for ever, Ramon,&rdquo; rustled out
another falling leaf.</p>
<p>But Ramon heeded not. Some of his treasure he spent rationally
enough, I must say, in having the old cottage repaired, and the old
vine tended; but the bulk he squandered in excesses, and in a few years
was as badly off as ever.</p>
<p>Want once more stared him in the face, and once more he resolved to
put an end to his existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not fit to die!&rdquo; said the patriarchal vine; but
Ramon hastened away, he had not the courage to encounter the dreadful
thought.</p>
<p>He snatched up a rusty, disused spade&mdash;he was out of conceit
with hanging. This time he would dig a deep hole in the ground, and
thrust himself in head foremost, and stifle himself that way.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>Digging was hard work for arms so unused to labour, but he had never
thought to find it so hard as it proved. He had not taken out a dozen
spadefuls when the spade seemed to refuse to enter the ground any more.
Had his arms grown so stiff they could not move? Or was the earth so
hard he could not break it?</p>
<p>The evening breeze rustled by, bearing with it some leaves of the
old vine; and as they passed they whispered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t die when you will, Ramon! Only be content to
work as hard as now in a good cause, and you won&rsquo;t want to die
till your time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Provoked into energy by what he considered a taunt, instead of being
softened by the fatherly counsel, he made one more desperate thrust of
the spade into the hole. Instead of entering deeper, its rusty pan
broke short off, but with a sound which showed him it had struck
against something made of metal; and putting his hand down to the place
whence the sound came, he distinctly made out the shape of a copper
vessel.</p>
<p>Here was a discovery which gave him a presentiment of another chance
of good fortune. Partly with the broken spade and partly with his own
hands, he succeeded in tearing up the soil around, and bringing to
light a large jar heavy enough to be full of gold; and so it proved.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus provided with means, Ramon once more commenced a new lease of
his dissipated life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my advice,&rdquo; said the old vine, &ldquo;and put your
treasure in something that will last, this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much trouble for Ramon. He went on in his old reckless
way, spending and taking no heed.</p>
<p>But during all the years of neglect, the brambles had overgrown his
ground; and his uncultivated place afforded a cover for idlers and
vagabonds. So it happened that when he was making one of his nightly
visits to his treasure he was overlooked, and, as you may readily
imagine, by the next occasion the treasure was <i>gone</i>.</p>
<p>His rage at this discovery was unbounded: he resolved now once for
all to have done with life, and let nothing interfere to prevent
him.</p>
<p>As he lay in bed that night, he contrived a plan to prevent all
possibility of escape, and with the first rays of the morning sun he
sallied out fully equipped.</p>
<p>He bore a rope and a blunderbuss, and he bent his steps to a crag
which overhung the sea, where he had marked a tree whose branches
spread over the briny waves. Tying his cord to a branch, he held his
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2371" title=
"Source: blunderbluss">blunderbuss</span> ready to blow out his brains
if the noose was too slack, while, if the rope should break, he would
at least have a good chance of drowning. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>Off he leapt with the rope round his neck; but the noose did not
draw itself tight. Faithful to his plan, he pulled the rusty trigger,
but, like every thing else belonging to Ramon, the gun was out of
order, and didn&rsquo;t go off; but as he hung struggling in the air
the old well-rope broke, and down he fell splashing into the sea. There
was no easy drowning for him, however; the water was not so deep as he
had imagined, and he was left floundering in the waves, and bruised
about among the sunken rocks.</p>
<p>Ramon had no fortitude; at each bump he could not restrain an
exclamation of pain, and the distressful cries attracted the attention
of no less a person than Carmen, who was gathering <i>esparto
grass</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2381src" href="#xd21e2381" name=
"xd21e2381src">2</a> on the wild coast at no great distance.</p>
<p>All her former womanly compassion returned when she saw her poor
Ramon in suffering and distress. Without an instant&rsquo;s hesitation,
she caught up a hank of strong <i>esparto</i> rope, which she used to
tie up her bundles, and hurried to the water&rsquo;s edge. Making one
end of it fast to a rock, with the vigorous exertion of an arm
strengthened by labour and directed by intelligence and affection, she
contrived to throw the other end within reach of his grasp.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>Ramon, who by this time had been long enough within sight of the
terrors of death to feel his wish to encounter it considerably cooled,
no sooner saw <i>who</i> was steadying the line, than he felt all the
love of life which is implanted in the heart of man revive with its
full vigour.</p>
<p>He caught the rope and twisted it round his arm, and with its aid
breasted the breakers. By the time he reached the shore, however, the
exhaustion consequent on so much excitement and exertion overcame him
so completely, that every remaining spark of ill-will in Carmen&rsquo;s
bosom was extinguished, and her only thought was how to restore him to
strength.</p>
<p>Her exertions were blessed with success, and his weakness found
scope for all her womanly sympathies, while her tender care roused all
the better qualities of his nature into action. Her smile mingled with
the visions of his feeble state, and warmed all his prospects of the
future.</p>
<p>When he dreamt of the dreary old house and its haunting associations
with the guilty past, he fancied he saw the sunny halo of her presence
dispelling all its gloomy phantasms, and her playful innocence
silencing even the convicting warnings of the stern old vine. Shared
with her, even labour seemed to lose its repugnance.</p>
<p>As soon as he was well enough, he opened to her his resolutions full
of repentance, which, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>with a woman&rsquo;s instinct, she
was forward to foster.</p>
<p>You will be pleased to hear that after all these lessons, crowned by
Carmen&rsquo;s winning confidence in his promised amendment, Ramon set
himself seriously to follow a new line of conduct. Carmen showed her
faith in his penitence by marrying him, and he took honest care that
she should never repent her generosity.</p>
<p>The old cottage once more looked homely and inviting; and in the
summer evening, when Ramon and Carmen sat resting beneath the shadow of
the old vine, now sturdy and fruitful under the culture it received,
and watching the gambols of a troop of <i lang=
"es">chiquillos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2412src" href=
"#xd21e2412" name="xd21e2412src">3</a> whom God had given them, the
leaves, as they fell rustling about them, whispered playfully in
Ramon&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to die now?&rdquo; And
Ramon in revenge plucked a bunch of ruddy grapes, and distributed it
among the happy party. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=

<h2 class="main">THE BALLAD-MAKER AND THE BOOT-MAKER.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a minstrel who went travelling about the
country from time to time singing sweet songs which people loved to
hear. His music was not like the music of the Spanish people, for he
came from the kingdom of Provence, and every one thronged to hear the
strange sweet melody. And when he had passed on, and there was no one
left to sing as he sang, people tried to remember his words and his
tones, and to sing like him.</p>
<p>At one of the towns where he passed there was a boot-maker, who, as
he sat all day alone at his last, diverted himself with singing; and as
he had sung a good deal, he thought he could sing very well. He was
much delighted with the minstrel&rsquo;s songs, caught up a good many
of them, and never tired of singing them&mdash;after his fashion. But
from being quite ignorant both of music and of the Proven&ccedil;al
language, he made, as we should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141"
href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>say, a great mess of it. Yet,
as the people knew no more about it than himself, they were very well
pleased to listen to him.</p>
<p>So, a long time after, when the Proven&ccedil;al minstrel came back
that way, they would not admit him, but cried out, &ldquo;We have one
of our own people who sings your songs for us as well as you, and we
need no Frenchman here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the minstrel was one greatly devoted to his art, he did not
merely sing for sordid gain; so instead of being angry because he was
supplanted, he was really pleased to hear that the people in that
far-off town had learnt the language and melody of his dear Provence;
and he said he would hear the boot-maker himself.</p>
<p>Imagine how great was his annoyance and mortification, when he heard
the beautiful ballads lamed and spoilt by the rude, unlearned attempts
of the boot-maker!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this man has been
deluding all the people into the idea that what he sings is like my
songs? And how can I prevent his going on keeping them under this
error?&rdquo; Then he bethought him what to do. He went by night to the
boot-maker&rsquo;s workshop, and putting all the wrong pieces of
leather together, he sewed them up into all sorts of foolish, useless
shapes.</p>
<p>When daylight returned, and the boot-maker came to his work, he was
in a great fury at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>what was done, and began shouting to the
neighbours to come and avenge him, for the Frenchman had spoilt all his
work. Then they all came running helter-skelter to exercise summary
justice on the minstrel.</p>
<p>But the minstrel stood up and confronted them, and said, &ldquo;Good
people! first hear me. This man is a maker of boots and I am a maker of
ballads. True I have spoilt his boots, I do not deny it; but he first
spoilt my ballads: what I have done is but fair. If you will hear us
sing one after the other, you will yourselves give judgment in my
favour.&rdquo; So the people told the boot-maker to stand up and sing,
which he did in his clumsy droning way, with plenty of false notes and
mispronunciations. After him the minstrel stood up and warbled his song
in tones so soft and sweet, that the people wondered how they ever
could have listened to the other, and with one voice they cried out,
&ldquo;The minstrel is right! The minstrel is right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the minstrel, who bore no malice, and had only acted out of
love for his art, repaid the boot-maker amply for all the damage to his
leather, but took a promise of him that he would never sing his songs
again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=

<p class="first">Such a carnation was once thus tended by a poor
village girl: it had grown up and blossomed and put forth its deep,
rich hues under her care, though she was so poor that she had nothing
to grow it in but a broken <i lang="es">olla</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2612src" href="#xd21e2612" name="xd21e2612src">8</a>.
Nevertheless when she thought of the happy day when it should become a
love-token to one worthy of her, she took such care of it, covering it
up when the sun was too hot, watering <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>it with water from
the purest spring, sheltering it from the wind, bringing it into her
room to guard through the night, lest any evil should befall it, that
never carnation flourished so gloriously; it was her only flower, the
object of her whole care.</p>
<p>One day there came into the garden a <i lang="es">maja</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2621src" href="#xd21e2621" name="xd21e2621src">9</a>
in her gala costume. According to the pretty Andalusian custom, she
carried a bunch of bright, sparkling flowers twisted into her raven
hair behind her left ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the handsome carnation from the depths of
its broken <i lang="es">olla</i>, &ldquo;why should it not be my lot to
adorn the head of this lovely creature, instead of being abandoned to
the care of a penniless peasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">maja</i> smiled, and passed round the garden two or
three times, to see if the carnation persisted in his idea. Every time
her black veil caught, as she passed, in the sharp edge of the broken
pipkin, the carnation wafted a soft sigh,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, why was I not born to adorn that shining hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">maja</i> deferred no longer to fulfil his wish:
throwing the bunch of showy flowers on to the ground, she plucked the
carnation and plaited it into her hair. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span></p>
<p>Right proud was the carnation to find himself thus grandly
enthroned; far too proud to have a thought of compassion for the other
flowers cast away for his sake; too triumphant even to smart under the
puncture of the hair-pin which fixed him on the <i>maja&rsquo;s</i>
head. Many a scornful glance he cast at the broken <i>olla</i> which
had been his nursery, and the cot of the lowly child who had nurtured
him.</p>
<p>Thus he was borne about, displaying his beautiful hues in the sun,
and charming every one with his perfume all day. Then night came: the
<i lang="es">maja</i> stood at her <i lang="es">reja</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2657src" href="#xd21e2657" name=
"xd21e2657src">10</a>, looking out for her serenader. He came at last,
and brought in his hand a beautiful white rose; the <i lang=
"es">maja</i> stretched out her hand to receive it with delight; with
loud and joyous thanks she placed it on her head, flinging the hapless
carnation from her without a thought.</p>
<p>Instead of blooming on his lordly stalk as at the first, the pride
and pet of the peasant maid, he was soon trampled to atoms by a drove
of pigs, passing on their way to market! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a poor young knight, and he went out
into the world, to seek adventures and do knightly deeds. As he went,
he met a man standing in front of a long narrow tunnel in a rock, and
blowing through it with his cheeks stretched like two ripe
pomegranates, to whom the knight called out, &ldquo;Halloa! fellow,
what do you do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made reply, &ldquo;Disturb me not, your worship, for
with my breath I am turning five hundred and thirty-two
mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the knight asked, &ldquo;Then who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;I am Blowo, son of Blowon<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2678src" href="#xd21e2678" name=
"xd21e2678src">1</a>, the good blower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the knight said, &ldquo;Will you come out with me to seek
fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;Your worship is not readier to ask
than I to accept, for I am tired enough of blowing.&rdquo; So he gave
one more good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>strong blow, enough to set the mills twirling
for a long time, and walked on behind the knight.</p>
<p>A little farther along they came upon a man toiling up the
hill-side, with a load of a hundred and thirty-two hundred-weight upon
his back.</p>
<p>To whom the knight called out, &ldquo;Halloa! man, you carry more
than a waggon with two yoke of oxen! Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;I am Porto, son of Porton, the
strong porter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the knight said, &ldquo;Will you come out with me to seek
fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;Your worship is not more ready to
ask, than I to accept, for I am weary of this burden.&rdquo; So he laid
the weight down by the road-side, and walked along behind the
knight.</p>
<p>A little farther on they came to a long stretch where the road was
very straight, and by the side a man walked up and down twisting a
rope, to whom the knight cried out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa! fellow, what do you there? and who are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;I am Ropo, son of Ropon, the cunning
rope-maker, and I make ropes which none can break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the knight said, &ldquo;Will you come out with me to seek
fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;Your worship is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>not
more ready to ask than I to accept, for I am weary of twisting this
rope.&rdquo; So he left there his rope by the road-side, and walked
along behind the knight.</p>
<p>A little farther on they came upon a man crouched down by the
way-side.</p>
<p>To whom the knight called out, &ldquo;Halloa! fellow, what do you
there? and who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;I am Listeno, son of Listenon, the
ready listener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the knight said, &ldquo;What are you listening for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;Blowo has left off turning the
mills, and I am listening for the wind to come down from the mountains
of Burgos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow! the mountains of Burgos are a hundred leagues
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that signify, if my hearing reaches as
far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the knight said, &ldquo;Will you come along with me and seek
fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man made answer, &ldquo;Your worship is not more ready to
ask than I to accept, for I am weary of straining my ears.&rdquo; So he
set up three flags, that all the country might know the wind would be
there in three days, and walked along behind the knight.</p>
<p>Then, after three days&rsquo; journey, they came in sight of a
magnificent castle, extending half a mile <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>every way over the
top of a mountain, but all desolate and in ruins; and the way up to it
was overgrown with interlacing brambles and briars, so that they could
hardly pass through. Then to increase their difficulty, a heavy storm
came on, which would soon have wetted them through; but Blowo cried
out,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, your worship; for I will soon clear the
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he blew a mighty blast, and sent all the big thunder-clouds
travelling back to the Sierra; and they went on toiling up the
brake.</p>
<p>When they came up to the castle, they found there was no door or
opening, nor any way in. Porto, Ropo, Listeno, and Blowo wanted to give
up the attempt, and pass on farther; but the knight would not hear of
abandoning the adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your worship is so determined,&rdquo; said Porto,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open a way for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he broke off a huge piece of rock as big as two men, and,
standing a hundred yards off, he flung it against the wall, with a
noise that could be heard a hundred miles off. The wall trembled and
clattered; but it was held together by a stronger than human power, and
all Porto&rsquo;s great strength could produce no effect on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go away from here, Master,&rdquo; pleaded Ropo,
&ldquo;this is no place for us. There is something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>wrong about this place; and the blessing of God
is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;we will first learn all
about it; there may be work for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they continued walking round the walls to see where they might
effect an entrance, and all to no purpose. By and by Listeno exclaimed,
&ldquo;I hear some one cry;&rdquo; and they all listened, but could
hear nothing. So Listeno made them follow him in the direction whence
the sound proceeded till at last they were near enough for the others
to hear the sound also; and they went on following it up, till they
came to the mouth of a great well all grown over with climbing-plants;
when they had cleared these away, the hole looked so black and deep, it
seemed as if it went down to the centre of the earth, and up the shaft
there came sounds of a woman&rsquo;s wailing, so loud and pitiful, they
were all moved to pity, and anxious to run to the relief of the
distressed person; but there was no means of telling how to reach the
bottom. Then Ropo came forward, and said, &ldquo;We will all go abroad,
and gather five thousand bundles of <i lang="es">esparto</i>, and
<i lang="es">palmito</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2759src" href=
"#xd21e2759" name="xd21e2759src">2</a> grass, and all five shall set to
work to make a long rope; and with that we will reach the
bottom.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>So said, so done. They gathered five thousand bundles of <i lang=
"es">esparto</i>, and <i lang="es">palmito</i> grass, and they all five
set to work under Ropo&rsquo;s directions and twisted away at the rope;
and now and then they tied a fragment of rock to the end and let it
down, to see if it reached the bottom. They went on thus for five
years, and at last it splashed the water, and when they let it down
again it sounded on the rock, and they found only a few feet of the
rope was wet, for the water was not deep.</p>
<p>Then Listeno put his ear to the top and told them it was not
standing water, but that a brook ran through, along the bottom of the
cave. As they were twisting the rope, they talked away about the great
deeds each would do; and each had a conjecture as to what they might
find at the bottom of the well. They all thought they should find a
treasure, and Porto said he would take it up on his shoulders and carry
it home for them, though it should weigh as much as all the lead of the
Sierra Almagrera<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2773src" href="#xd21e2773"
name="xd21e2773src">3</a>.</p>
<p>But when the rope was finished, and it was a question of who should
go down, not one of the knight&rsquo;s followers, though they had been
boasting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>so loudly before, would venture down into the
well. So the knight laughed, and said <i>he</i> was not afraid; and one
end of the rope having been lashed tightly to a rock, the four
followers undertook to pay it out steadily, and down the knight
descended into the black, gloomy depth.</p>
<p>Day and night he went on steadily descending for three days and
three nights, and at the end he came into the water. It was not more
than breast high, so he waded through it for several yards till he came
to a place where the bank widened sufficiently for him to get out and
walk along it; and then he came to some trees, and through the trees
was an open space lighted by a lurid light which came from a deeper
cave. On a sloping bank, covered with shining grass and strange
flowers, lay a beautiful princess all dressed in white, and decked with
shining jewels; and as she lay, she moaned and cried and prayed for
deliverance. So the knight was hastening towards her, and drew his
sword to cut the bonds which confined her, but at that instant up
started a fierce demon whom he had not observed before, as he lay
coiled up at the mouth of the cave.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2786width"><img src="images/p154.jpg" alt=

<p class="figureHead">The Ill-tempered Princess.&mdash;<i>Page
154.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, fine <i lang="es">caballero</i>!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;for she is mine, and you will have to fight me before you
can touch her.&rdquo; The knight disregarded the menace, and continued
his way towards the princess, but the air was stiff all around
him&mdash;though he could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href=
"#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>see no hindrance, he found he
could not make any way towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; roared the demon, &ldquo;my fine <i lang=
"es">caballero</i>, you&rsquo;ll find you will have to do with me at
last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you?&rdquo; shouted the baffled knight,
&ldquo;and what is this beautiful princess to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bound to answer the knight who asks that
question,&rdquo; answered the demon, &ldquo;or it is little you would
have learnt from me. Know, then, that this princess was the only
daughter of King Eur&iacute;c, to whom belonged all the country as far
as eye can see; and she would have succeeded to his kingdom, but her
temper was so violent, no one could bear with her. Upon the least
contradiction she would order a subject to be executed; and her
arbitrary conduct was continually involving the kingdom in discontent
and trouble. Her father, who tenderly loved her, used to coax her and
use every endeavour to soften her, but with no avail. At last, one day
she provoked him so sore that in his anger he exclaimed, &lsquo;Go to
the horned one!&rsquo; When I heard myself called, I hastened to seize
her, but, notwithstanding all my speed, before I could arrive he had
revoked the curse, and so I was tricked out of her. This happened
several times, but each time fatherly fondness was quicker than my
utmost haste. At last, a day came when she excited him greatly,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>and he said again, &lsquo;Go to the horned
one!&rsquo; and before he could recall the words that time, he had
fallen down a lifeless corpse. So now she is mine, and mine she must
remain till some knight will win her in arms from me, and marry her,
and restore her to her castle and her kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will I!&rdquo; said the knight stoutly; for though he
feared the lady&rsquo;s violent temper after what he had heard, his
devotion to chivalry bound him to use his best endeavours to deliver
her.</p>
<p>Accordingly he drew his sword, and called to the demon to come on.
&ldquo;Remember one thing,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;if you should
win her, she is yours for ever; <i>I</i> take her back no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime, Listeno, at the top of the well, had been reporting to his
companions all that he heard going on below, and their curiosity
getting the better of their fears, they let themselves down by the
rope, and all four arrived in time to witness the terrible contest.</p>
<p>Never was such a fight seen in this world as that between this
knight and the demon; and at last the knight cut off the demon&rsquo;s
ear. No tongue could describe the demon&rsquo;s rage at finding his ear
in possession of a mortal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my ear!&rdquo; he cried in tones so sharp that they
almost stunned Listeno&rsquo;s sensitive hearing powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied the knight, &ldquo;or at least not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>without a heavy ransom. In the first place I
exact that without further ado you reinstate the Princess in her castle
and all her power.&rdquo; The demon stamped and raged, but the knight
was firm. The demon was ashamed to go home without his ear, so he
thought it best to comply.</p>
<p>The Princess was restored to her throne, the castle was restored to
its strength, the garrison was restored to the ramparts, the servants
were restored to the halls. The knight married the princess; great
rejoicings and festivities were celebrated, and to his four followers
were given places of trust and consequence in the palace.</p>
<p>The demon often came to beg for his ear, but the knight felt that at
some time or other he might have need of him, so he would not lose his
hold over him.</p>
<p>For a time all went well enough, but by little and little the
Princess forgot her years of adversity and the debt she owed the
knight: she grew more and more wilful, and before a year was out she
had become so violent again, that he grew weary of his life, and
declared he could no longer endure the continual turmoil. Remonstrance
and coaxing were alike unheeded, and it was vain that he tried her
father&rsquo;s remedy, for the demon had sworn never to take her
back.</p>
<p>In this strait Porto reminded him of the ear he held in hostage,
adding, &ldquo;I will take it upon myself <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>to deliver you of
her.&rdquo; So putting the bottle of brine in which the ear was kept
into his pocket, he swung the Princess over his shoulder, and all her
struggling was useless against &ldquo;the son of the strong
porter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus laden he went to find out the demon. &ldquo;You are to take
back this princess, she is only fit for your company,&rdquo; he said,
when he had found him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; answered the demon, grinning: &ldquo;I told
your master when he <i>would</i> have her he must take her for good and
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this ear?&rdquo; then asked Porto, showing him
the bottle.</p>
<p>The demon clutched at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast!&rdquo; cried Porto. &ldquo;If you want to have
it back, this is my master&rsquo;s condition: you must take back the
princess along with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, crest-fallen and glad to get his ear back on any condition, the
demon accepted the bargain as it was dictated to him; and the princess
who could not command her temper never found another knight to deliver
her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=

<h2 class="main">THE HERMIT AND THE FIG-TREE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an old man of Toledo who had one son, whom
he brought up in the fear of God. Now it happened that this old man had
to go to a distant town of Estramadura, to receive some money of a
creditor, and the creditor dying, his heirs disputed the debt, and
drove the old man to a lawsuit which kept him absent many years. When
at last the suit was just decided in his favour, the old man fell ill
and died. Meantime the son, growing uneasy at his father&rsquo;s
prolonged absence, arranged his affairs as well as he could, and
prepared to take the journey to see after him. Calling in his three
clerks, Jacinto, Gonzalo, and Diego, who were all men whom his father
trusted, and whom he therefore respected, he divided his property in
three parts, and to each he gave charge of one part, leaving it to each
to do the best he could for him, saying, &ldquo;The wisdom of your grey
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>hairs will do better for me than any
instructions my inexperience could give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Lord bless it, it shall increase; and if He curse it,
it shall not prosper,&rdquo; answered Jacinto, the eldest;
&ldquo;behold I am nothing in the matter;&rdquo; and he shook his
venerable head, and raised his eyes to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever I have done for your father I will continue to do
for you,&rdquo; said Gonzalo, the second in order, and hurried back to
his papers as if it was wrong to waste a moment in talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will endeavour that you shall have nothing to complain
of,&rdquo; quietly replied Diego, the third.</p>
<p>The young man was pleased with what they said, and without further
loss of time set out on his journey.</p>
<p>The weather was fair, and his father&rsquo;s friends by the way
received him hospitably; but crossing the Sierra<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2872src" href="#xd21e2872" name="xd21e2872src">1</a>, a violent
storm came on, and he would soon have been drenched with rain. Right
glad he was to see, perched on the mountain-ledge, a hermit&rsquo;s
cell, where he readily found shelter. In the morning, when the sky was
serene again, he rose to take his leave; and as he stood on the
threshold thanking the hermit for his care of him, he could not forbear
pausing to admire the beauties around him. Far away stretched the
plains below, studded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>with smiling cities and watered by
the mazy windings of the rivers, and shaded by dark groves of ancient
cork-trees; behind him were rocky heights reaching to the sky,
presenting every degree of rich vegetation and solemn barrenness. But
what attracted his sight most of all was a luxuriant plantation of
fig-trees, which made a complete bower of the hermit&rsquo;s cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How successful you are with your fig-trees!&rdquo; said the
traveller; &ldquo;I never saw so fine a show. You have three, one as
fine as the other&mdash;it is impossible to say which of them is most
flourishing; and to judge by the fruit you gave me, which doubtless is
their produce, they are the finest trees in Spain, and that is saying a
great deal. I must add too, after your liberality with them, that you
put to shame the proverb,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;En tiempo de higos</p>
<p class="line">No hay amigos<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2887src" href=
"#xd21e2887" name="xd21e2887src">2</a>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;For what you say of the proverb, son,&rdquo;
replied the hermit, &ldquo;I have no merit, for it is the very essence
of my rule of life to call nothing my own, according to our
Lord&rsquo;s counsel. These figs are the gift of God, to me, or to you,
or to whomsoever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span>is here to need them. But for the rest, you
judge according to the measure of the inconsiderateness of your years.
Nevertheless, you seem to me a good youth, and I will therefore show
you something which may be of use to you in your dealings with the
world. Know then that but one of these fig-trees is really what it
seems; the other two are worthless. That is, worthless,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;as bearers of fruit, for there is nothing that God makes
but has its worth, and even these trees which bear no fruit are useful
to give shade, and for other purposes besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surprise me,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;I never
saw trees of more equal promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, it is as I say; and if the season of figs were
not just over, according to our Lord&rsquo;s saying, by their fruit you
should know them, or, as you say in the world, &ldquo;<i lang="es">al
freir, lo vereis</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2901src" href=
"#xd21e2901" name="xd21e2901src">3</a>.&rdquo; Meantime, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>learn, my son, not to judge of men and things by
their appearance, but wait and see what their fruit is like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was now beginning to make way above the horizon, and,
fearing to be overtaken by the heat, the young man was obliged to set
out on his journey without further parley than promising to visit the
hermit on his return.</p>
<p>Great was his grief, when he arrived at the end of his journey, to
find his good father had been so suddenly called away, and instead of
being clasped to his bosom, to find the last earthly communication he
could ever receive from him was a scrap of paper, on which, at
intervals of his death agony, he had convulsively written down a few
directions to guide him in entering into possession of his worldly
goods, mingled with counsels to him to continue to direct all his
dealings according to the fear of God.</p>
<p>This sudden death had thrown matters into some confusion, and it
took a considerable time to set all straight again; it was some ten or
eleven months before the young merchant had to re-cross the Sierra in a
homeward direction.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant summer evening when he came upon the
hermit&rsquo;s cell again. The old man was sitting making his
meditation before the door. Occupied with grief and care, as he had
been during his absence, the bereaved son had forgotten all about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>the fig-trees; but, on looking around, he saw
that something was changed, and soon had a clear demonstration of what
the hermit had told him. One noble tree was laden with the ripe green
and purple fruit; the soft, downy skins seeming ready to burst with the
rich and luscious burden within, while the broad leaves spread out
their hands and shaded them from the too great heat, and fanned them
gently when the day was sultry.</p>
<p>The second tree was covered with luxuriant leaves as before, but not
a single ripe fig was on it&mdash;there were a few young green
beginnings, but too small and sickly to have a chance of ripening that
season.</p>
<p>The third tree was in lamentable plight; its attenuated climbers
clung by habit to the rock, but the sap and life and energy were gone,
and it seemed only fit to be cut down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, father, I see you were right as to the figs,&rdquo;
said the young man, candidly. &ldquo;There is only one of them that is
a good tree after all&mdash;but it is wonderful how well favoured they
looked last year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn, my son, the counsel of the aged and the words of the
wise,&rdquo; replied the hermit; &ldquo;for as it is with trees, even
so it is with men. There are many who seem to you alike honest and
worthy to be esteemed, while their inner life is as different as was
the fruit-bearing principle of these trees.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father, will not the good be known by their good deeds
and maxims, and the bad by their evil lives and counsels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, my son, but the difficulty is to discern which are
good and which evil. This is not so easy as you seem to think; for
instance, you see two men both apparently pious and charitable, while
the one who appears most so, very possibly only gives his money to the
poor that he may stand well with the world, that the poor may look up
to him, and say, &lsquo;There goes one who is like a king among
us;&rsquo; the other, whose liberality you noticed less, drops his
hardly-spared coin noiselessly into the <i lang=
"es">capillo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2937src" href="#xd21e2937"
name="xd21e2937src">4</a>, and sallies forth perhaps in dead of night
to carry his alms to those who would blush to receive such assistance
by day. One man appears to you calm and placid because he is of a
phlegmatic nature, and has no effort to make in order to appear equable
and ever patient; while another, whom you judge to be hasty and
passionate, may be all the while struggling to conquer a hot and
violent temperament which requires the courage of a hero to keep it
within bounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your moral, father,&rdquo; replied the young man;
&ldquo;and I have no doubt I often judge of men as I judged your
fig-trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; continued the hermit, pointing to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>one whose fruit was even then affording a
delicious meal to the birds, for the hermit called nothing his own, and
the birds of heaven were welcome to share his stock, &ldquo;that one
was always a good and fruitful tree, and its praise is among its
people, for you will find many a village about here which boasts a
graft from the hermit&rsquo;s fig. The second one, which presented so
fair a show, has something amiss which it hitherto has passed my skill
to find out&mdash;though I have one remedy more to try, which
<i>may</i> recover it. And the third had a worm at the root which
destroyed its vital power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man passed on his way next day, and, as he journeyed, the
figs of which the good hermit had given him ample provision put him in
mind of his parable, and set him musing on its application. These
musings weaving themselves in with his anticipations of the condition
of his affairs at home, he began to consider whether the three clerks,
to whom he had entrusted his property, were in any way like the
fig-trees, and whether Providence had not sent him this lesson to be
his guide in his future conduct.</p>
<p>Possessed with this idea, he resolved to put them to the test. The
sun and air of the mountains had dyed his skin; sorrow had marked his
face with lines of care and tinged his hair with grey. By means of a
false beard and a travelling merchant&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>dress he reckoned he could be safe from
recognition, and as a stranger learn their respective worth from their
own lips.</p>
<p>Equipped in his disguise he presented himself at his own house, and
found all three in their place, with every evidence of diligent
application. So he opened the terms of his pretended business to them,
and found them all ready to negotiate with him, each in his
degree&mdash;each conducted his matter with every token of due
shrewdness and integrity.</p>
<p>It had been part of his plan to tell them the news of their
master&rsquo;s death, and try them by watching the effect of this
intelligence upon them, but when he saw all so well-ordered he judged
there was no need for further trial, and so contented himself with
resuming his own attire and returning in his own person to the
house.</p>
<p>The clerks greeted him with a joyful welcome, and received the news
of his father&rsquo;s death with becoming expressions of sorrow, and
the young man congratulated himself on having such trusty stewards of
his goods.</p>
<p>After he had been back a day or two, he requested them to prepare
for him the account of what they had done since he left, so that he
might know how his affairs stood, and once more assume the direction of
them. The proposal received a ready assent, and a day was fixed for
going into the matter. But when the appointed day came, what
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>was his astonishment to find only Diego in his
place? His accounts were ready and all in good order; he had
administered faithfully the portion of property entrusted to him, and
handed it back increased by the efforts of his prudence and skill.</p>
<p>From Gonzalo he found a letter informing him that he had had the
misfortune to be unlucky in his speculations with his property, and had
lost the whole of it, consequently he had no account to render. Losing
patience at this attempt at deceit, the young man had him brought
before him, and asked him how he dared tell him so, when he knew that
only so many days before he had been negotiating with a merchant he
knew, and he named the name he had assumed in his disguise. Gonzalo was
not at all disconcerted: &ldquo;Oh, that business was done with my own
money; though I was unlucky with yours, fate would have it that I
should be very successful with my own, and out of my own earnings I
have created a capital which I have multiplied an
hundredfold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the young man heard this unblushing statement, he was filled
with indignation, and insisted on taking him before the judge. But it
was all to no purpose, Gonzalo had managed his fraud so cleverly that
it could not be proved against him; he had to be let go scotfree.</p>
<p>As for Jacinto, <i>he</i> never showed himself at all, nor left any
explanation. He had remained up to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"
href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>the hour, trading with the
benefit of his master&rsquo;s name and capital, but the moment there
had been talk of giving up accounts he had gathered up all that was in
his charge, and fled with it out of the country.</p>
<p>More grieved by the faithlessness of those he had trusted than by
the loss of his gold, the young man shut himself into his chamber, to
muse upon what had befallen him, and upon the uncertainty both of
friendship and riches. When he reflected on the temptations which money
had offered to Gonzalo and Jacinto, he was appalled at the thought of
those which might be in store for him, if he continued in the pursuit
of business. He thought of the peaceful hermit, whose warning parable
had just received such a striking illustration. He thought of his
placid content with the weather&mdash;such as God sends it&mdash;to
warm him, and the fruits of the earth&mdash;such as God gives
them&mdash;to nourish him. He thought of him far removed from
contentions and greed of gain, and sharing his frugal meal with the
stranger, the wayfarer, and the birds of heaven.</p>
<p>When he came down from his chamber, he called Diego to him, and
commended him for his faithfulness and diligence. &ldquo;And,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I now give you full possession of all that you have so
justly administered. For me, I have chosen a life free from care, where
I shall have no use for money.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>But when Diego heard it, he said, &ldquo;Nay, but I will go with
thee. To save my master&rsquo;s goods for his son was my work on earth;
now that is fulfilled, no desire have I to continue amid its weariness
and perils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they left the money to found an hospital where poor orphan
children might be taken in and taught the way that is right. And they
went into the Sierra, and built them huts and planted them fig-trees,
and passed their time in holy meditation and in praising God.

<p>The good wife of the house gave him a fried sprat<a class="noteref"

nothing. The blind beggar, however, who knew the smell of fried fish
well enough, charged him with the theft, and gave him a good drubbing
in punishment.</p>
<p>Presently, as they went along, the mischievous lazarillo led him

nasty old ruined house for our playground, Lolita!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you like it, Ana? I do so love to come here
and listen to the tales the Wind tells me, as it moans through these
crumbling walls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tales the Wind tells you, <i lang=
"es">hermana</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3032src" href="#xd21e3032"
name="xd21e3032src">1</a> dear! what can you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot! you don&rsquo;t know the Wind&rsquo;s language;
but I do, and I love to listen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lolita dear, do tell me what the Wind tells you! What
does it say about this ruined cottage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it told me <i>such</i> a strange story, Ana! It said to
me, &lsquo;A long, long while ago, when I was one day dancing happily
this way on a sunbeam, this old ruined cottage was then just built; all
was then bright and new within and without; the cock strutted about the
yard, keeping his fowls in order, and shouting, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Qui
quirri qui!</i>&rdquo; the hens <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174"
href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>gathered their chickens under
their wings, crying, &ldquo;<i lang="es">C&aacute;, c&aacute;,
c&aacute;, c&aacute;!</i>&rdquo; the cat sunned himself on the
projecting roof, and frightened the birds from the cherry-tree that
shaded it; and the dog ran about wagging his tail, and keeping them all
in order, with one eye at least ever open for the rabbit that would
poach in the lettuce-bed. On the sunny side of the house was a
magnificent <i lang="es">parral</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3054src"
href="#xd21e3054" name="xd21e3054src">2</a>, where every evening might
be seen Pepito and Dolores sitting together in newly-wedded bliss.
Pepito would be sawing or nailing wood, which was to make a cradle, and
Dolores, stitching away at little fine bits of clothes that looked as
if they were meant for a fairy. They were so happy, that whenever I was
sent that way I used to step aside and ask my sister the Breeze to
sweep round that corner for me, because I am rough and she is gentle;
and I used to love to watch how pleased they were with her refreshing
visit, after the burning heat of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But it happened one day that I had to go a long, long
journey: some pirates were ravaging the sea, and I was to kick up a
storm which would frighten them away from some poor and hardy sailors
who were not strong enough to encounter them; and then I had to sweep
round the north of Africa, to disperse an army of locusts that were
preparing to ravage the land and destroy the work <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>of
the husbandman. So I passed through the <i lang="es">parral</i> as
gently as I could, and kissed the young couple under it, and went
lightly on my way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was some months before I was sent to Spain again,
but the first chance I had I went as near as I could to this cottage;
and as I came along, my attention was attracted by another cottage,
which seemed to me something like it, so I looked in: there was only
one cheery old man inside it, and he was making preparations for a
journey. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they be pleased to see me? How little they
think I could come so soon!&rdquo; he muttered, as he put his bundle
together. I made the air clear and fresh for his journey, and passed
along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As I went over the mountains, I came upon a couple of
muleteers directing a file of laden mules; they looked hot and wayworn,
so I blew the dust off them, and cooled their feet, and the hoofs of
their beasts. As I came near I recognized my friend Pepito, but he no
longer looked so happy as of old; his expression was dark and anxious,
and it grew gloomier as he listened to some sombre tale his companion
was telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Are you sure&mdash;certain sure?&rdquo; he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;<i lang="es">Mas cierto que el reloj,
hombre</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3075src" href="#xd21e3075" name=
"xd21e3075src">3</a>,&rdquo; replied the sinister companion, whom I now
also recognized for a fellow of very bad reputation in Pepito&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>village, and who was said to have vowed
vengeance on Dolores because she had married Pepito instead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And if I turn back to-night, I shall find him
of whom you speak in my cottage?&rdquo; continued Pepito, in an
agonized tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; returned the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now I would not believe any ill of Dolores, so I tried
what I could to divert their attention. I threw myself so violently
against the face of the leading mule as to make her miss her way, and
nearly step over the brink of the precipice which the path they were
travelling bordered; but Pepito was a practised muleteer, and caught
her head in time to prevent an accident. Then I blew his hat over the
edge, but he was as good a mountaineer as muleteer, and readily climbed
down the steep side after it. I could do no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Damp mists were gathering along the banks of the
Guadalquivir: my mission was to disperse them before they became
injurious to health. I might not tarry, so I passed on my way, sighing
through the tall trees. But before the sun rose next morning, I
contrived to reach Pepito&rsquo;s cottage. No one was stirring, but I
easily made my way in through the open windows. There lay in the bed in
calm and peaceful slumber, the old man whom I had seen making up his
bundle in glad expectation of his visit proving a joyful surprise. The
doors and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>casements rattled for fear, as they always
<i>will</i> do when they see me coming, and I was vexed to find my
curiosity had thus disturbed the old man&rsquo;s sleep. But there was
something worse than my coming to rouse him. First there was a noise of
footsteps under the window, then the barking of the watchful dog, then
the sound of some one climbing up the wall, then groping his way
through the window. The old man started in his bed, nerved with the
consciousness that he was the guardian for the time of his
son-in-law&rsquo;s property; he hastily disengaged his <i lang=
"es">navaja</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3097src" href="#xd21e3097"
name="xd21e3097src">4</a> from his belt by the bedside, and stood up to
grapple with the intruder, who, similarly armed, advanced straight into
the room with an assurance which showed he was no stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I perceived that Pepito, misled by his perfidious
friend, had returned in the night-time, so as to prove the truth of the
report given him. When he found himself confronted by a man&rsquo;s
arm, he felt no longer any doubt, but closed upon him in rage and fury.
I had no heart to stay and see the result of a fight between two armed
and desperate men, but I set up my loudest and most desolate howl, and
swept madly through the <i lang="es">pueblo</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3104src" href="#xd21e3104" name="xd21e3104src">5</a>. I made the
branches of the trees crack, and the fittings of the houses clatter;
wherever I saw a door or gate open, I set it banging to and fro, and by
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>supreme effort, I even moved the great
church-bell so that it gave one or two deep tolls. Thus wakened, the
people soon heard the cries and recriminations of the combatants, and
ran out of their houses in numbers to track the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is part of my fate that I must ever be moving
onward; I can never stand still and never go back, though I can make a
grand sweep over a large tract of country, and so come round again to a
place after a time. It was a long time, however, before I was able to
work my way round after this, but one day I happened to overtake my
sister the Breeze, and knowing the interest I had taken in the young
couple under the <i lang="es">parral</i>, she immediately began telling
me about them; I desired nothing more than to learn what had befallen
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hope you will
never have to go by there again, you couldn&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I began to suspect what had happened that fatal night.
&ldquo;Then the neighbours were not in time to part the men after
all?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;They were parted, but both died of their wounds
next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;And Dolores?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Dolores was so horror-stricken at the dreadful
sight, that she entirely lost her reason. Some good people have taken
her quite away, far, far off, thinking she may get better in an
entirely different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179"
name="pb179">179</a>]</span>scene. But all the time she was here, I
used to stir gently through the room to fan her burning forehead when
the air was sultry; and I often looked deep into her eyes when they
stared so wildly, seeking for Pepito and her father, who she always
thought were coming to see her, and I always saw there a look which
told me she was not long for this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;God take her in His mercy!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
&ldquo;And the <i lang="es">parral</i> and the cottage, what of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;All left desolate. The hares and the foxes have
the grapes to themselves. No one will go to live in the house. No one
will even pass by it if they can any how avoid going that way; and I
hope you will keep away from it too, brother, for the sight would make
you sad indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Our ways parted here; and I was not sorry, for my
heart was too full for more talk. I need hardly say that on the first
opportunity I went to see how the old place looked. And sad enough it
seemed; sadder even than now, because the memory of Pepito and Dolores
was fresher upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I feel so sad whenever I am there, that I moan and
sigh, and the simple people say it is Pepito and his father-in-law
crying out against each other. Sometimes, wild with anger, I feel ready
to crumble the whole place to atoms&mdash;and then I dash down beams
and stones and branches of trees; and then, again, I fear to lose all
the traces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>I have loved so well, and I blow sand and mould
and seeds of creeping plants to bind the scattered portions together,
and root them again to the spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a dreadfully sad story, Lolita; it has made me
feel shyer than ever of this dreary place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wind&rsquo;s stories are always melancholy, Ana dear;
though you don&rsquo;t know his language, you hear that his tone is
always plaintive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t want any more of the Wind&rsquo;s stories.
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I like. I like the sights I see in the
Sunbeam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell me what you see in the Sunbeam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must come out of this dreary place, and sit down
with me on the sunny bank yonder, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what I have
seen.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;When I lie on the <i lang=
"es">tomillar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3158src" href="#xd21e3158"
name="xd21e3158src">1</a> and look through the sunbeams,&rdquo; said
Ana, &ldquo;I see all the little sprites getting ready the beautiful
colours to paint the flowers and the insects, and the clouds, and
others that dye the tree-leaves green and gild the old walls, and
others that teach the insects to hum and the birds to sing, and little
children to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Lolita,&rdquo; pursued Ana, &ldquo;when a little
baby is put into the cradle for the first, very first time, if the
Sunbeam plays upon it, the little sprites always look after that baby,
and never forget it, but when it is grown up into a big man or woman
they still continue their care. There was once such a little baby,
Lolita, born in a poor little cottage; such a poor little cottage,
Lolita, that there were no shutters to the windows of any kind, when it
was ever so hot the sun all came in, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>and made the air
suffocating, unless the poor mother could pin up an old dress; but it
was not often she had one besides the one she had on. So it happened
that when this little baby was born, Lolita, the sunbeams were
streaming in, with the little sprites all basking in them, and the
sprites kissed this little baby, and said, &lsquo;Dear little girl, we
will never leave you; only be good, and so long as you are good we will
see that you shall want for nothing at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very little while after, Lolita, that little baby&rsquo;s
father died, and you might have said the sprites had forgotten her; but
it was not so. They kept their word exactly. She did not know her
father had died. Her mother was there, and took care of her, and she
was too little to know that other children had more pleasure, so she
wanted nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not even know, Lolita, the labour her poor mother had
to work for them both, and even when she sang her to sleep with her
sad, ceaseless song,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;En los brazos te tengo,</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span></p>
<p>she knew nothing of its meaning; her little face was pressed close
and warm against her mother&rsquo;s breast, and a flower or a fruit,
which the sprites had painted for her, was enough to complete her
happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before Pura&mdash;such was her name&mdash;was two years old,
her mother died too. But the sprites had not forgotten her, Lolita: her
mother had a sister, and when this sister came to the funeral, they had
painted Pura&rsquo;s cheeks with such fresh, clear tints, and lit up
her baby face with such a bright, sweet smile, that her aunt would not
part from her, but took her home and brought her up as her own child,
and was to her as a mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sprites played with her now just as before; and when she
was asleep they used to dance on her bed, and say, &lsquo;Dear little
girl, we will never leave you; only be good, and so long as you are
good we will see that you shall want for nothing at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime, Pura grew up to learn to be useful: she worked in
the garden, and kept the house tidy, and fetched the water from the
fountain, and did all that <i lang="es">Tia</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3204src" href="#xd21e3204" name="xd21e3204src">3</a> Trinidad
wanted. She was very good and very obedient, and never wasted her time;
her only amusement was lying on the thyme-bed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>in
the sunshine, because then the sprites painted such pretty dreams for
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad was growing old, and after
her there was no other aunt, nor any relation to look after Pura; and
though she would not say it aloud to vex Pura, who was always bright
and gay, she yet continually repeated in her own mind, just as the poor
mother used to sing,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">

<p class="first">&ldquo;So things looked very bad again, Lolita; but
the sprites had not forgotten Pura, as you shall see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad earned her living by waiting on

great gentleman who had returned from the Indies with a great lot of
money; he said he had roamed the world long enough, and seen enough of
great cities; he meant now to settle himself in some quiet, remote

industrious wife, who would make his home smiling and happy.

missed a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you?&rsquo; said the traveller, not at all
displeased at her boldness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That can I,&rsquo; continued <i lang="es">Tia</i>
Trinidad, earnestly; &lsquo;and there isn&rsquo;t a girl to match her
in Madrid, and the <i lang="es">Padre Cura</i> will bear me
out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What ... Pura, you mean ... I suppose?&rsquo; said the
<i lang="es">Cura</i>, somewhat embarrassed between his desire to speak
the truth, and his fear of crushing the&mdash;as it seemed to
him&mdash;exaggerated ideas of his poor parishioner. &lsquo;Yes, Pura
is a good girl enough;&rsquo; and he paused to think how much he could
say in her favour; &lsquo;young, and&mdash;pretty, and&mdash;simple,
and&mdash;lively, and&mdash;notable altogether,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; interrupted the traveller, hastily,
&lsquo;out with your <i>but!</i> for you have named the very qualities
which go to make up my ideal of a wife; speak, <i lang=
"es">hombre</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3271src" href="#xd21e3271"
name="xd21e3271src">6</a>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I mean&mdash;I mean, only that she is a
little&mdash;a little&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;a little
<i>homely</i> for <i>your</i> wife&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Homely</i>, is it? Oh! if that&rsquo;s all, we
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186"
name="pb186">186</a>]</span>quarrel. I don&rsquo;t want any of your
fine ladies who are only thinking of setting themselves off, and attend
to nothing but their toilet! Come, good woman, ask your young friend to
allow me to come and see her to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too overjoyed to answer, <i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad set
off on the instant at full speed, and ran so fast you could not have
told what her gown was made of as she passed. When she reached home,
out of breath, she told her niece to adorn the house, and dress herself
in her best, for she expected a visitor next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pura&mdash;who, though now seventeen, still kept up her
simple habit of doing whatever she was bid with
alacrity&mdash;fulfilled the directions given her with great exactness
and success, and never thought of asking who or what the visitor was,
or what business brought him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the traveller called next morning, and found the room so
smiling, the sunbeams playing through the muslin blinds upon the
snow-white curtains, the brightly-tinted flowers&mdash;which, by the
way, the sprites had painted on purpose&mdash;so tastefully arranged,
and Pura herself looking so neat, and with no thought of display in her
head, he was delighted, and left with an air of satisfaction, which
convinced <i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad that all was going on right.
Only, as he was going away, he turned and asked <i lang="es">Tia</i>
Trinidad if Pura could make lace; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>and <i lang="es">Tia</i>
Trinidad, who deemed her niece such a pearl that there was nothing she
could not do, without thinking, answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
Nevertheless, poor Pura had had too much labour with the garden and the
house-work all her young life to have had leisure for indoor
occupation. She could take a turn, indeed, at her aunt&rsquo;s
spinning-wheel; but such an accomplishment as making lace she had never
practised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why did you tell the gentleman I knew how to make
lace, when I don&rsquo;t, aunt?&rsquo; she exclaimed, for she could not
bear an untruth about the least matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I did not know what to say, all in the
surprise,&rsquo; replied the good aunt. &lsquo;It seemed as if I should
give a false impression of your habits, which are so industrious, if I
said you could not do any thing he expected of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say that I could spin, and
scour, and dig?&rsquo; answered Pura, ingenuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dig, and scour, and spin, indeed! Fine recommendations
for <i>his</i> purpose,&rsquo; rejoined the aunt, mysteriously; and
before Pura could ask what on earth this &lsquo;purpose&rsquo; was, a
messenger brought in three bobbins of fine black silk, for her to make
into a piece of lace, as a proof of her skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, aunt, what shall we do? What <i>shall</i> we
do?&rsquo; sobbed poor Pura, who could not endure to be thought a
deceiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, child,&rsquo; returned the aunt,
&lsquo;something <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"
name="pb188">188</a>]</span>or other will turn up. There&rsquo;s
nothing so easy as making lace, after all, and three bobbins are gone
like winking. You <i>must</i> get through it somehow, for your fate
depends upon it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pura went to bed that night crying; and cried herself to
sleep. But very early in the morning, very early indeed, Lolita, the
sunbeams woke her&mdash;you see the sprites never lost sight of her.
And three beautiful sprites&mdash;the three who had most care of
her&mdash;came floating down the Sunbeam. Without saying a word, they
took up the bobbins of silk, for they had brought every thing with them
that was wanted for making lace, as if they had known all about it,
and, rattling them about, <i lang="es">en un dos por tres</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3337src" href="#xd21e3337" name=
"xd21e3337src">7</a>, they turned off a splendid mantilla, all made out
with flowers, and birds, and every thing you can think of, and then
threw it on the bed, and disappeared before Pura had time to recover
from her surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the stranger called next day, and saw this extraordinary
proof of industry and skill, he could hardly believe his eyes, and went
away more pleased than the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell <i lang="es">&aacute; su
merc&eacute;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3347src" href="#xd21e3347"
name="xd21e3347src">8</a> that she was a jewel?&rsquo; whispered the
old lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I begin to think you did not exaggerate,&rsquo;
answered the traveller. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, turning to Pura, he asked her if she was as perfect
in household duties as in accomplishments; whether, for instance, she
understood cooking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="es">&iexcl;Pues no ha de saber cocer<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3359src" href="#xd21e3359" name=
"xd21e3359src">9</a>!</i>&rsquo; interposed the aunt, without allowing
Pura time to speak; for she knew the good girl would have answered the
strict truth; and she thought as the sprites had got her out of one
scrape, they might be trusted to get her out of another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the evening, the messenger came again, this time followed
by two other porters, each carrying baskets of provisions, which they
set down, with the message that Pura was to make a famous <i lang=
"es">olla podrida</i>, and the gentleman would come in and dine off it
the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pura&rsquo;s tears fell fast on the beautiful market spoil,
on which <i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad stood feasting her gaze. Never
had such a provision of generous diet stood within sight of her hearth!
But Pura only reflected on her incapacity to deal with such choice
materials, and she knew there was no help to be got from her aunt, to
whose <i>cuisine</i> even a piece of bacon was a rare delicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pura went to bed that night as sad as the night before, for
she kept saying to herself, &lsquo;Suppose the gentleman should think
it is I who have been deceiving him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the sprites did not forget her, Lolita. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>Very
early in the morning&mdash;very early!&mdash;they came in on the
Sunbeam, as bright and as beautiful as before; and in a trice they had
laid the fire in the stove and blown the charcoal into a fine red glow;
then, while one took down the large <i lang="es">ollas</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3387src" href="#xd21e3387" name=
"xd21e3387src">10</a> from the shelf, and filled them with water at the
well, one was busy plucking the fowls, and another washing and
preparing the vegetables. The vegetables were soon put on in one
<i lang="es">olla</i> with the bacon; and then the fowls, the ham, the
sausages, the tripe, the pigs&rsquo;-fry, the rolls of lean meat nicely
larded and stuffed, all set to stew in another, and all seasoned with
the greatest care and delicacy. The whole morning Pura watched the
sprites. And though <i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad saw nothing but the
Sunbeam playing about the kitchen, Pura saw them, as they carefully
skimmed the pots, added to the liquor or the flavouring, made up or
slackened the fire; then, an hour before dinner-time the contents of
the two <i lang="es">ollas</i> were mingled with care, and once more
set on to simmer, while with herbs, and bread-crumbs, and garlic,
pimento, and parsley, certain <i lang="es">alb&oacute;ndigas
gruesas</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3402src" href="#xd21e3402" name=
"xd21e3402src">11</a> were being made ready, and fried in sparkling oil
to a fine golden hue, ready to drop into the <i lang="es">olla</i> the
moment before serving up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traveller came, faithful to his appointment, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>and
the delicious odours of the <i lang="es">olla</i> met him directly he
entered the garden-gate, overpowering the perfume of the carnations on
the window-sills. Proudly <i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad bore in the
lordly dish, for she knew that never in the palace was a more perfect
stew served. The traveller dined with undisguised satisfaction; he
confessed it was the <i lang="fr">ne plus ultra</i> of cooking. Nothing
was wanting, of nothing was there too much, every thing was in its due
proportion and proved the handiwork of a true artist in cooking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As you understand so well how to prepare this homely
dish,&rsquo; he said, at the close of many compliments, as he took
leave, &lsquo;I am sure your delicate taste must be equally faultless
at confections&mdash;I shall ask you to make me a <i lang=
"es">turron</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3425src" href="#xd21e3425"
name="xd21e3425src">12</a> to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pura, struck dumb with perplexity, was vainly striving to
frame some speech by means of which to explain how little part she had
had in the performances he had been led to ascribe to her; but while
she was yet thinking, her admirer had already plucked a carnation for
her hair, and, raising his hand in affectionate farewell, had taken his
departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad busied herself with putting by
the remains of the abundant meal: there was meat enough to last her
frugal needs a week, and more, and some to spare for a poor neighbour
besides. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>While she schemed and portioned, Pura, torn by conflicting thoughts,
stood still, with the carnation in her hand, gazing after the form of
the stranger as he disappeared among the trees, and wondering why she
had not courage to run after him and explain all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She stood thus leaning against the window-pane, and still
gazing, perplexed, hours afterwards, when the same messenger who had
visited her on the two evenings before, again appeared, with a load of
almonds and filberts, pine-kernels and walnuts, honey and eggs. Pura
took the things from him with a heavy heart, for she was much too
humble and simple to expect that the sprites <i>could</i> be so kind as
to help her again; so she went to bed in as great distress as on the
preceding nights. Nevertheless, early in the morning&mdash;very early,
very soon after sunrise, that is as soon as the sun was up high enough
for his beams to get in at her window&mdash;in came the three sprites,
and, without saying a word, set to work, just as they had the day
before; then began such a wonderful bruising, and pounding, and mixing,
that Pura soon lost all fear of the work not being performed as
perfectly as on the two former occasions. They had not yet half
finished their mixing, when all of a sudden she noticed a soft buzzing
sound, like the humming of bees, but all in beautiful melody; and then
she saw the Sunbeam full of sprites of every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>hue
like living flowers. They were the genii of the flowers, and they wore
the very forms of the flowers, their bright petals making so many
wings, and they came and poured each its own perfumed nectar into the
confection, giving it a flavour such as no <i lang="es">turron</i>, of
earth at least, ever possessed before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We have done all these things for you,&rsquo; said the
sprites, when they had completed their handiwork; &lsquo;now, we want
you to do one thing for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, whatever you like! only tell me any thing I can
do!&rsquo; answered Pura, with a ready grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, it is this. We know three poor girls, very poor
and very sick; they are all terribly deformed cripples. They are so
deformed and so ugly that they live in the hospital, and never get
asked any where. It would be such a pleasure to them to come to your
wedding-f&ecirc;te. They will be no ornament to it, I know; but still,
will you let them come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes; to be sure, poor things;&rsquo; answered
Pura, with grateful and charitable alacrity; &lsquo;that is, whenever I
get married. But who would marry a poor penniless orphan-girl, who can
do nothing? More likely I shall have to go to the hospital too, when
aunt dies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, no; you&rsquo;re going to be married very soon, to
that traveller who has been here so often.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What; to that kind, handsome gentleman!&rsquo; cried
Pura, in raptures. But a moment after, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>cloud stole over her
joyous countenance; and, hiding her face in her hands, she said, sadly,
&lsquo;No; <i>that</i> can never be. I dread even to meet him again,
because we have been deceiving him. Oh, it was very wrong; I would not
have done it for the world if I had had time to speak. If he wants to
marry me, it&rsquo;s because he thinks I&rsquo;m so clever; and when he
finds I can do nothing he will turn his back, and that is not the
worst. When he finds he is deceived, and I can do nothing, oh, how he
will despise me!&rsquo; And she sobbed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, it is not because you are clever,&rsquo; answered
the sprites; &lsquo;it is because you are good. If you have not learned
more, it is because you had not the opportunity. You have always been
industrious at doing what you did understand; and as to deceiving him,
that has never been your will and intention. So cheer up! we will make
it all right. Only don&rsquo;t forget to invite the three poor girls
from the hospital to the feast.&rsquo; And the sprites floated away on
the sunbeam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be sure I shall not forget them, poor things!&rsquo;
cried Pura after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day the stranger came again; and having tasted the
exquisite <i lang="es">turron</i>, which seemed indeed to have been
perfumed by no ordinary taste, he told <i lang="es">Tia</i> Trinidad he
hoped she would let him marry her niece at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing the old lady desired more; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>for
she had inquired about him meantime, and found he was a worthy man, as
well as abundantly supplied with this world&rsquo;s goods; so all was
speedily arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To her surprise, when she came to announce her good fortune
to her niece, and to arrange preliminaries with her, she found she was
any thing but pleased, and only burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, child! what ever is the matter with you?&rsquo;
she exclaimed. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t like him?
I&rsquo;m sure he has spoken kindly and fondly enough to you. And what
is more, he has spoken kindly and fondly enough behind your back, too;
which shows his esteem is genuine, and no mere flattery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s just what makes me so
wretched,&rsquo; sobbed Pura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, wretched to think a good man loves
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, aunt, no; but to think that he is so good and so
kind, and we have been deceiving him. When he finds I can do none of
the things he has fancied I am so clever at, what will he think of me?
With what face can I meet him? Will he ever respect me again?&rsquo;
and she sobbed harder than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense, child, don&rsquo;t take on like that,&rsquo;
responded the aunt. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got through it all so far. Do
as I bid you, and it will all come right in the end.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pura, used to obey, and trusting in great measure also to the
promises of the sunbeam-sprites, prepared to do her aunt&rsquo;s
bidding, though with somewhat mixed feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the wedding-day was fixed, and all preparations made,
Pura did not forget to go out early into the <i lang="es">tomillar</i>,
and ask the sprites of the sunbeam how she should find their
prot&eacute;g&eacute;es, the three cripples of the hospital.
&lsquo;Leave that to us,&rsquo; said the sprites. &lsquo;You have done
your part in remembering them. We will take care they have the
invitation; only give us the token by which they may be sure of being
admitted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A red and white carnation will suffice,&rsquo;
answered Pura; and a cloud overshadowed the sunbeam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wedding came, and the <i lang="fr">f&ecirc;tes</i>, and
the cripples. A pitiable sight they were, indeed. They were still
young; but their distorted forms only made their youth a motive for
greater compassion. The back of one was curled over so that her chin
touched her waist, and her arms were so short they were no longer than
the fins of a fish. Those of the second were so swollen that each was
the size of her whole body, and you could scarcely tell which was
which; and on her forehead was a great swelling like the horn of a
rhinoceros. The skin of the third was all shrivelled and seamed with
scars, and her eyes were red all round, and stood out from her head
worse than those of a lobster. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197"
href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pura!&rsquo; exclaimed the bridegroom, as they made
their approach, &lsquo;how on earth did these three scarecrows get in?
they are almost enough to cast an evil eye on our happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Say not so, beloved,&rsquo; replied Pura; &lsquo;they
are three poor girls who might have been as happy as you and I, but
that misfortune overtook them. Their life is sad enough, shall we not
try to make them glad for once, on our own happy day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sweet child, you are right, and I was hasty,&rsquo;
answered the bridegroom; &lsquo;but how did you come to know
them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some one who was very kind to me seemed to take an
interest in them too, and asked me to invite them, that they might have
one bright day at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then, if that is the case, they have my heartiest
welcome; I had rather see them here than if they were the highest
duchesses of the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with that he sent the friend who attended to marshalling
the guests, to put them in the best places, nearest to the bride and
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, he could not get over his curiosity, to know
why they were formed in such an extraordinary manner; and when the
conversation began to get sufficiently general and familiar, he went up
to the first, and after an exchange of ordinary compliments, and
feeling his way by little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>and little, at last allowed
himself to say in the politest tone,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e3530" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span><i>May</i> I ask, dear friend, how it is
your back comes to be so bent, and your arms so very short?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while he waited in great perturbation, lest he should
have offended or hurt the poor thing, she answered cheerfully
enough,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By all means, I am not at all ashamed of it. I used to
be a famous hand at making lace, and my step-mother, finding she could
make a lot of money out of my work, kept me at it so hard that from
bending over it so much my back never came straight again; and my arms,
from continually twisting the bobbins, got quite worn away and screwed
like into the sockets, and never <i>would</i> come out any
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; exclaimed the bridegroom, almost
abruptly, for his alarm got the better of his courtesy; and with that
he sprang to the side of his bride, and exacted from her a promise that
she would never never make any lace from that day forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pura gave the promise willingly enough; and, his composure
somewhat restored, her husband before long found his curiosity lead him
to the side of the second &lsquo;scarecrow&rsquo; guest, to ask her why
her arms were so <i>very</i> thick, and why she had such a bump on her
forehead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; she answered, in a tone which seemed
to show she was pleased to have the opportunity of explaining the
circumstance, &lsquo;because I used to be a rare hand at making
<i lang="es">almendrado</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3555src" href=
"#xd21e3555" name="xd21e3555src">13</a> and <i lang="es">turrones</i>
of every kind, and from continually pounding, pounding at the almonds
and nuts, my arms grew as thick as you see; and as I often knocked my
forehead with the big pestle we used, I got this ugly bump.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With greater trepidation than before, he darted, at hearing
this, to Pura&rsquo;s side, and taking her hand in his, required her to
promise him with the greatest solemnity that she would never touch any
confectionary again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Encouraged by the good-natured reception his curiosity had
met with in the two former cases, he soon found himself by the side of
the third cripple, asking her why her eyes were so red and goggled, and
her skin so scarred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because I was a famous cook,&rsquo; was the answer.
&lsquo;I was married very young, and my husband was very particular
about his dinner. I never could be away from the cooking-stove, there
was always something to be got ready; and that injured my eyes. And
worse than that, one day I had a frying-pan in my hand, full of boiling
oil, and I was just going to drop in the chops, when bang went a pane
of glass. Some one had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href=
"#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>frightened the cat, and in he had
bounded through the window, scattering the glass right and left. The
noise gave me such a start, that I upset the frying-pan over the heated
stove, the oil flared up in my face, and burnt me all over as you see
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without retaining sufficient self-command to say the few
words of sympathy and consolation which would not have failed him at
another time, he hasted back to Pura, and insisted that then and there
she would promise him never to touch a frying-pan or an <i lang=
"es">olla</i> more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Pura understood why the sprites had bid her invite the
cripples to her wedding; and she had her reward for her charity. And
you see, Lolita, dear, how they kept their promise. So no wonder I am
fond of looking into the sunbeam.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">THE PEDRO JIMENEZ GRAPE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a well-to-do vine-grower named Pedro
Jimenez, who cultivated a small tract of land on which his fathers had
lived for many generations before him, and had been known throughout
the district for men of undoubted <i lang="es">pundonor</i>, by which
word Spaniards express the most scrupulous nicety of honourable
conduct. Blessed with all other worldly advantages, Pedro Jimenez had
one great trial&mdash;he had no child to whom to transmit the name he
had received from his predecessors, and himself borne so creditably.
When he reflected on this, there was one thought in the background
which used to distress him. There was living at a sufficient distance
to be quite unknown to his neighbours, a poor relation of his wife,
whom he assisted frequently in secret; but he had never let the
knowledge of the humiliating circumstance transpire. Yet he knew that
this poor hard-working man with difficulty kept his family above want;
that the greatest delicacy in which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>they could ever
indulge was the dish popularly called <i lang="es">duelos y
quebranto</i>s (sorrows and troubles), a stew made up of the poorest
odds and ends and leavings<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3590src" href=
"#xd21e3590" name="xd21e3590src">1</a>, in bitter mockery of the
favourite Spanish <i lang="es">olla podrida</i>, which is a compound of
the most succulent meats and vegetables.</p>
<p>Conscience would whisper in Pedro Jimenez&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Here,
in this poor fellow&rsquo;s son, is an heir whom you may adopt; take
him from the present temptations to discontent and dishonesty with
which privations ply him, and bring him up according to the traditional
maxims of your house.&rdquo; But when he thought of the details of
bringing the ragged lad to his respectable homestead, and the
neighbours pointing to him as the relation of the wealthy Pedro
Jimenez, his courage failed him, and he turned from the idea. So years
passed by, and this thought remained the weak point of Pedro
Jimenez&rsquo;s otherwise irreproachable character.</p>
<p>One evening, as he was strolling through his vineyard, admiring the
beautiful clusters of grapes which were his riches for the coming year,
he was disturbed by the mournful howling of a dog, proceeding from the
road-side at no great distance. His kind heart prompted him immediately
to follow up the sound, and he was not long before he came upon a
saddening sight. On the ground lay the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>prostrate form of a
delicate youth, foot-sore and travel-worn, and now brought to a state
of unconsciousness through exhaustion; by his side there lay a large
shaggy dog of pitiable aspect; his bones almost protruded through his
skin, his eyes were glassy and wild, and he trembled in every limb. His
melancholy howling grew fainter and fainter, and by the time Pedro
Jimenez got up to the group, he saw he was past the reach of help; with
one more distressful howl, he rolled on his back and expired, having
spent his last breath in summoning aid to his young master!</p>
<p>Pedro Jimenez lost no time in raising the youth in his arms, and
bearing him to his own comfortable home, where his wife&rsquo;s kindly
care soon restored him to animation. Refreshed by her attentions, he
was soon able to tell his tale; and what was the surprise of the good
couple when they learnt that the poor child they had so charitably
entertained, was no other than the son of their poor relation.
Nevertheless his history was a sad one. His father and mother had both
fallen victims to an epidemic disorder in their village; kind
neighbours had taken in the younger children, a convent had provided
for two older girls; and the eldest boy, having been used to labour all
his life, had manfully resolved to be a charge to no stranger, but had
set out to seek the advice and direction of the only relation he had to
look up to, in finding work by which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>could support
himself, and lay by enough to portion his younger sisters. As the weary
boy told his tale of domestic heroism, Pedro Jimenez&rsquo;s better
nature stirred within him. He no longer stifled the dictates of
conscience, no longer suffered himself to be governed by a false and
foolish fear of human respect, but took his young kinsman by the hand,
told him he was proud of his spirit, and that as Heaven had denied him
direct heirs, he would henceforth make it depend entirely on his own
good conduct to become the heir to his comfortable competence.</p>
<p>The orphan lad was overjoyed at the prospect. In his little world
the name of Pedro Jimenez had all his life stood as the embodiment of
all that was respectable, and desirable, and worthy of imitation. To be
suddenly elevated to the position of aspiring to one day himself
inheriting that honoured name, with all its contingent advantages, was
greater happiness than he had ever dared to entertain in his wildest
dreams.</p>
<p>Pedro Jimenez had every reason to be satisfied with the decision he
had come to. All the neighbours who were sufficiently men of worth to
make their opinion a matter of consequence, far from looking down on
him for the disclosure, warmly applauded his generosity; and in return
for the few worthless ones whose acquaintance he lost by it, he won for
himself the affection of a devoted son. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>The old man had never
known a greater pleasure than that he now found in taking his adopted
child out with him day by day, and instructing him in all the various
arts of treating the vine&mdash;the mode of planting and culture, the
vintage, the pressing of the grape, and the disposal of the wine; and
to all this, his young charge listened with an earnestness and
intelligence that repaid all his care. His frugality, and industry, and
straightforward manly conduct on all occasions&mdash;his almost
feminine kindliness of manner in supplying to the best of his power the
offices of the old wife, when God took her home, all rendered the old
man quite easy as to the future successor to his name.</p>
<p>At last the time came when Pedro Jimenez the elder, full of years
and honour, was called to his account; and as his adopted son turned to
meet the desolation of the lonely house, there was one thought of
consolation to gild his bereavement, the sense that he could make his
whole after-life a token of obedience to the upright maxims of his
benefactor, in whose stead he now stood.</p>
<p>While our hero had been living in rustic tranquillity in the
remotest part of the south of Spain, great events had been stirring
Europe. The tumultuous tide of the French Revolution had overflowed the
Peninsula. I will not detain you with any thing you can consider a dry
epitome of history. Suffice it to say, that in consequence of the
troubles in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>which his country was involved, young Pedro
Jimenez was called to join the army.</p>
<p>Having felt, as I hope you have, some interest in the honest pride
with which he was on the point of entering on his inheritance, I am
sure you will sympathize with the sadness of heart which now
overshadowed him as he was obliged to <span class="corr" id="xd21e3620"
title="Source: abandom">abandon</span> his fair homestead just as it
had become his own. &ldquo;It is well the old man never suspected it
would come to this! ... and then peace must come and restore me to my
home some time or other,&rdquo; he used to say to comfort himself
during the weary march or tedious drill. There was, however, yet a
heavier trial in store. It was the policy of the intruded French ruler
to send away the native troops out of their country, and replace them
with French troops. Now it happened that Pedro Jimenez was attached to
the regiment of General Romano, which was one of those selected for
foreign service. Ordered to the banks of the Rhine, poor Pedro Jimenez
seemed farther than ever from the fulfilment of his darling hopes. He
had perhaps felt the defence of his country some compensation for the
separation from home; but to fight for the unjust aggressions of one
who was the usurper of the throne of his native land was surpassingly
hard. When not joining his comrades in lamenting their hard fate, he
would wander over the country, trying to find any incident which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>might remind him of his beloved Andalusia. His
attention was thus arrested by the vines which he found growing on the
heights around. The knowledge of the subject he had acquired during so
many years&rsquo; apprenticeship, and under so experienced a master,
now proved invaluable. His practised eye readily distinguished among
the varieties presented to it a superior variety adapted to the soil
and climate of Andalusia, and he determined, whenever Providence was
pleased to give him an opportunity of returning, that he would provide
himself with the means of propagating this stock in his own
plantation.</p>
<p>Nor was this opportunity very long withheld. General Romano, though
scarcely taller than the length of an ordinary man&rsquo;s arm<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3627src" href="#xd21e3627" name="xd21e3627src">2</a>
bore in his little body a large and loyal heart: by dint of persevering
efforts, he succeeded in making a way of escape for his whole regiment,
shipped them, and carried them safely round to a friendly port of
Portugal, and thence draughted them all back into Spain, where they did
good service under Wellington.</p>
<p>Pedro could hardly believe his ears for joy, when the mysterious
order was transmitted to him, to prepare for the secret return: yet he
did not in his transports forget the coveted vine. The plant thus
obtained, tended and preserved with much <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>care and anxiety
through the voyage, might still have been condemned to perish, had he
been called to active service; but the rough life and the long voyage
had impaired his health. After several months in hospital, during which
time, you may be sure, he did not neglect his precious plant, he was
sent home invalided.</p>
<p>He found his own <i lang="es">vi&ntilde;a</i> in a sad state of
neglect; but his native air having soon restored his strength, he was
able within a few years more, not only to bring it round again, but
also to produce a goodly show from his newly imported vine-stock. And
from this vintage it is&mdash;the Rhenish stock planted in Andalusian
soil, and cultivated with tender care and intelligence&mdash;that we
get the choice variety of sherry wine (you can ask Papa to let you
taste it some day at dessert) called &ldquo;Pedro Jimenez.&rdquo;

<h2 class="main">ST. MARTIN IN SPAIN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About the time that the Pedro Jim&eacute;nez vintage
was coming into growth, a favourite old vintage of Spain was just
becoming exhausted, or for some reason going out of fashion,&mdash;the
white wine of San Martin, so called from the locality of its production
in Castilla la Vieja, not far from Toledo.</p>
<p>Now it happens that in Spain&mdash;where Christianity has woven
itself more familiarly perhaps than any where else into the home
traditions of the people, and every class and state of man has assigned
to it a special patron&mdash;that St. Martin is counted the patron
Saint of drunkards. &ldquo;Patron Saint of drunkards!&rdquo; you will
perhaps exclaim; &ldquo;what have Saints got to do with
drunkards?&rdquo; But think a little, and remember how mercifully our
Lord associated &ldquo;with publicans and sinners,&rdquo; that He might
reclaim them, and then you will say it is not so strange after all.
Drunkards are very few in Spain, so few that there is no idiomatic word
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>call them by&mdash;nothing but the popular
mocking expression <i lang="es">borracho</i>, which is simply formed by
putting a masculine termination to the word <i lang="es">borracha</i>,
a wine-skin; for you know it is the common practice in Spain, to store
all the wine that is intended for use within a short period, in skins
instead of barrels. And very curious it is, I assure you, when you are
travelling in Spain, to see great skins of pigs and goats, sometimes
with the hair still on, hanging up in the wine-shops, swelled out to
their utmost extent with wine.</p>
<p>I was curious to find out how St. Martin came to be reckoned the
<i>male-wineskin&rsquo;s</i> patron; and in course of my inquiries,
came upon two or three little traditions which may amuse you.</p>
<p>One was, that in a church much frequented by large numbers of the
poorer peasantry, there was, among other pictures, one representing St.
Martin dividing his cloak with the beggar, according to the legend you
have all heard. But it happened that the painter, in the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e3663" title="Source: plentitude">plenitude</span> of
his idealism, had made a slight alteration in the usual treatment of
the figures. Instead of putting a beggar kneeling by the wayside and
sturdily asking alms, he had drawn one lying down in the extremity of
exhaustion, and with scarcely a rag to cover him. St. Martin, instead
of being in the act of cutting his cloak in halves with his sword, as
you usually see him, was tenderly placing the already severed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>portion of his garment over the shivering form
of the beggar. But the execution of the picture was not equal to the
conception: the livid face, with its red and purple lines, by which the
painter had thought to depict the effect of cold and want, was taken by
the people to show forth the swollen features of a drunkard, and the
attitude of exhaustion, for one of helpless intoxication. St.
Martin&rsquo;s part in the picture was reckoned to be the saving him
from the ridicule of the passengers, by covering him up. This act of
patronage, so assumed, was reckoned to extend to all victims of
drunkenness.</p>
<p>Another story told me, was, that it arose from a waggish remark made
by an Andalusian on another and more normal picture of St. Martin.
Andalusians are famous for their wit. It is said that the soil of Spain
is adapted to produce every thing required for both the necessity and
luxurious enjoyment of human life, except spices; but that this is
supplied by the spice of Andalusian wit, for an Andalusian hardly opens
his mouth but to say something witty.</p>
<p>An Andalusian, then, being asked what he thought of a certain
picture of the legend of St. Martin replied, it represented such a
piece of folly that none but a drunken man could have committed it. And
the connexion thus once set up between a Saint and the condition of
inebriety, though in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>jest, was sufficient to fasten on him the
patronage of the inebriate.</p>
<p>But for my own part, I am inclined to think that the vintage of San
Martin, though now seldom spoken of, having at one time been regarded
all over Spain as the first vintage of the world, popular tradition
naturally ascribed the care of those who partook of it to the Saint
whose name it fortuitously bore.</p>
<p>In inquiring thus about St. Martin, I found that Spaniards have a
jesting way of calling one San Rorro also, patron of drunkards; and
this puzzled me, as I could find <i>nothing like</i> San Rorro in the
Calendar. Then I learnt that <i lang="es">rorro</i> means a child just
beginning to walk. Now a drunken man staggers much in the same way as
an infant first learning to support its own weight; and thus &ldquo;San
Rorro&rdquo; is merely a punning allusion to this similarity. But the
Spaniard, who, as I have said, weaves his Christianity and&mdash;I may
add&mdash;his innocent jest into every thing, remembering that the
Divine Infant must have tottered too in His first early efforts to
walk, sees a connexion here which may suggest an occasion for Divine
pity and patronage. Certainly the common immunity from bad consequences
of their falls, has led all countries to fable about a &ldquo;special
Providence for drunkards.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213"

Archangel Michael on the occasion of a miraculous visit to the place.
An arch&aelig;ologist who was at great pains to investigate this
matter, after spending much time over the inquiry, traced it very
satisfactorily to an occasion in which, some hundreds of years ago, an

St. Michael was one of the <i lang="la">dramatis person&aelig;</i>. A
feather having fallen from the wings employed on the occasion, was
picked up and preserved with the care which so religious a people
naturally bestowed on any thing connected, however remotely, with a
sacred matter; and in process of time, the local circumstances being
forgotten, the feather was ascribed to St. Michael the Archangel
himself.</p>

which were regarded as a work of great piety and erudition. Difficult
passages were elucidated with so much plainness, that it was said
metaphorically in his epitaph, that his works enabled the blind to

<h3 class="main">THE FLOATING CHEST.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cardinal Xim&eacute;nez, who founded the celebrated
University of Alcal&aacute;, was desirous to spread the knowledge of
these commentaries, which were falling into oblivion; and he thought to
render a service to religion by having a new edition of them published.
As the art of printing was at that time more developed in the Republic
of Venice than in Spain, he found he could bring it out more
advantageously there; accordingly the manuscripts were packed and sent
thither.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that crossing the Mediterranean, the ship in
which they were was overtaken by a tremendous gale; and to save the
lives of the passengers, the captain ordered all the merchandize to be
thrown overboard, so as to lighten the ship. The chest containing
Alfonso Tostato&rsquo;s works was cast into the sea with the rest.</p>
<p>Next morning, when the danger was past, the person who had been
entrusted by Xim&eacute;nez with the care of the manuscripts was in
great distress at the irreparable loss: not daring to return to Spain,
he wandered along the shore, hardly knowing what he did, when, lo and
behold! to his intense delight, there appeared suddenly, floating in
the sea, the identical chest, the loss of which was the cause
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>of his mortification. A boat was quickly
despatched to haul it in with great joy, and the event was commonly
regarded as a marvellous interposition. But it would seem that the
sagacious Xim&eacute;nez, foreseeing the possible calamity, had ordered
that the chest should be constructed of the lightest wood; and all who
have ever had a swim in the Mediterranean know the peculiar buoyancy of
its waters. Perhaps we may now account for the chest floating.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A modern Spanish writer gives the following solution
of a popular tradition that a whale was once seen making its way up the
Manzan&aacute;res. The Manzan&aacute;res is a singularly shallow river,
at certain times of the year not half covering its bed, which rendered
the tradition still more marvellous<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3747src"
href="#xd21e3747" name="xd21e3747src">2</a>.</p>
<p>The solution is this: &ldquo;A wine-merchant living on its banks was
once unfortunate enough to have an accident in his storehouse or
cellar, by which a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"
name="pb217">217</a>]</span>number of wine-skins were sent floating
down the stream. The wine-merchant ran along the bank, calling on the
neighbours to arrest the float, the rather that one of the skins was
full of wine; and as the danger of losing them increased, he went on
crying frantically, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Una va llena!</i>&rdquo;
(&ldquo;One of them is full!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Now Spaniards make but a scarcely perceptible difference between the
sound of <i>b</i> and <i>v</i>, so that his cry sounded in the

the wonders of the day; and among other extravagant exaggerations, it
was reported that the sun had stood still to give the victorious
Spaniards time to pursue their enemies.</p>
<p>When the Duke of Alva returned, Charles Quint inquired of him his
account of the event. The Duke, who did not wish either to compromise
his veracity or diminish the honours of the day, replied, &ldquo;Sire,
I had too much occupation on earth for my thoughts to have leisure to
observe what took place in the heavens.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">MERINO.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">You have often had to wear a merino frock and merino
socks, I dare say; but perhaps you do not know that the fine soft wool
of which these are made comes from Spain. It is more interesting to
know that there is a tradition which says that the particular breed of
sheep from which this wool is taken, came originally from England;
their coats improved greatly in quality under the genial climate of
Spain, and some people have supposed that the name <i lang=
"es">merino</i> is a corruption of <i lang="es">trans marino</i>,
because they came from <i>over the sea</i>. Others derive it from the
word <i>Merino</i>, an old title in use in the kingdom of Leon, meaning
an overseer, and think that the sheep, having on their first arrival
been given into the care of a Merino, or overseer, the name continued
to be applied to the animals after it had ceased to denote the
office.</p>
<p>Others, again, derive it from the word <i lang="es">merino</i>,
which denotes the migration to which these sheep <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>are
subjected; for in the hot weather, when the grass of the lowlands gets
withered up, they have to be driven into the mountain pastures.</p>
<p>There is some doubt as to the date of the importation of the sheep;
but most probably they were taken as part of the dowry of Catherine,
daughter of John of Gaunt, when she went to marry Don Enrique III.,
King of Leon and Castille. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=

<h2 class="main">KING VAMBA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the time that the Goths governed Spain, there
was once an interregnum. The stock of the last dynasty was extinct, and
every one who could collect a few supporters set himself up to rule
over the rest, so that there were several calling themselves kings at
once, and fighting with each other for the mastery. Of course this led
to the greatest confusion, for there was no one to keep order.</p>
<p>At last, as they found they could not agree among themselves, they
sent to Rome to ask the Pope to decide for them. So the Pope went into
his oratory, and prayed God to tell him which of all the candidates
should be King of Spain. But when he came out again to the envoys, he
told them that none of the pretenders were worthy to wear the crown;
that he who was to be King of Spain would be found ploughing his land
with a grey and white ox, and a priest walking by his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>side; that he would be found somewhere in
Andalusia, and that his name would be Vamba.</p>
<p>The envoys came back to Spain in no very cheerful mood; for they
said, &ldquo;How shall we find this man?&rdquo; And then they searched
Andalusia over, and could find no one whose name was Vamba. Just as
they were going to give up the search in despair, as they were passing
through a bank planted with canes they heard a woman with a basket on
her shoulder call out, &ldquo;Come and dine, Vamba! You seem to forget
it is twelve o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the envoys heard that, they turned round again, and saw a man
ploughing in a field with a grey and white ox. So they went back, and
threw themselves on their knees before him, and spoke in this
manner,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us your hands to kiss, your majesty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Vamba, full of astonishment, and at a loss to understand them,
thought they must want to kill him; and exclaimed, trembling,
&ldquo;Spare my life, <i lang="es">Se&ntilde;ores</i>! Why do you seek
to take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they answered, &ldquo;We have no such thought, Vamba. Far from
it. The Pope who now reigns in Rome told us that you were to be our
king; and our king you must therefore be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Vamba, who could not believe they were serious, stuck the
<i lang="es">vara</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3834src" href=
"#xd21e3834" name="xd21e3834src">1</a> he held in his hand for a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>goad, into the ground; and said, laughing,
&ldquo;When my <i lang="es">vara</i> shall take root, and bring forth
flowers, then will I believe that I am King of Spain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, behold! before he had finished speaking, the <i lang=
"es">vara</i> became covered with leaves, and from its branches sprang
beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>When Vamba saw that, he hesitated no longer; but called his wife
Sancha, and his children, and went along with the envoys to Toledo,
which was the capital of the kingdom of the Goths.</p>
<p>The envoys sent messengers on before, to tell the Council of the
kingdom that the king was coming. The Council rose in a body, and went
out to meet him; and all the people followed behind, and the joy-bells
were set ringing.</p>
<p>Thus King Vamba made his entrance by the Gate of Cambron, the
noblest gate adorning great Toledo; but when he saw the Alcaide of his
palace bearing the sword before him according to custom, he begged, in
his humility, that he would not bear a sword, but that his children
might go before him to show that he loved peace and love, rather than
war and strife; and so he went on into the city.</p>
<p>And all the people looked out of their balconies, and
cried,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Toledo and Spain for Vamba!</p>
<p class="line">And also for Queen Sancha!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But as the cry swept over the bosom of old father
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>Tagus, the golden Tagus who reflects the glories
of all Spain, he bore the cry along gladly and soft, but yet inverting
the order,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;All Spain hails thee first,</p>
<p class="line">And then her chief city Toledo!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Thus they conducted the good king to the palace, and
there they led him to the bath; and then they trimmed his red <i lang=
"es">melena</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3874src" href="#xd21e3874"
name="xd21e3874src">2</a>, and arranged it so that it might not fall
into his eyes; and they combed out the hair of his beard, but left it
long and noble; and they put on him a royal robe with gold embroidery
and an ermine collar, though he would have it sober in colour, and on
his breast a blood-red cross.</p>
<p>Queen Sancha, too, they arrayed in a robe of green velvet, with gold
and jewels round the border, her beautiful golden hair unbound, falling
loose over her shoulders and reaching down to her palfrey.</p>
<p>The ladies went before, and strewed the ground with flowers, and
filled the air with benedictions.</p>
<p>And thus they went forth to the cathedral to be crowned. And all the
people ran to their balconies as they passed along, and cried,&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Toledo and Spain for Vamba!</p>
<p class="line">And also for Queen Sancha!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But as the cry swept over the bosom of old father
Tagus, the golden Tagus, who reflects the glories of all Spain, he bore
the cry along, gladly and soft, but inverting the order,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;All Spain hails thee first!</p>
<p class="line">And then her chief city Toledo!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Like King David, taken from the sheep-fold to be ruler
of the people, Vamba made a very good king. His reign is spoken of in
history as &ldquo;the era of wisdom and justice.&rdquo; He had not,
like later sovereigns of Spain, to fight the Saracen intruder on his
own soil; but he did more, he crossed the sea to check his advancing
power on the African coast, and returned towing two hundred and seventy
vessels which his prowess had taken from the enemy. If equal
determination had been shown in succeeding reigns, the Moslem had never
obtained a footing on Christian soil.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though respected and beloved by his subjects, Vamba
was destined not long to enjoy the peace he so ardently loved. The
ambitious men who had been contending for the crown before his
accession, continued unyielding and restless. Pretenders rose up in
Navarre and the Asturias, and Ilderic, Count of Nimes, at the same time
set up the standard of revolt in the Gaulish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>provinces. Vamba marched in person against
Navarre, and sent Paulo his general to Nimes. But Paulo, instead of
going to chastise the rebel, procured, on his own behalf, the
assistance of Remismundo, Duke of Cantabria, and proclaimed himself
king. Vamba, though he had been made king without his own seeking,
determined that the sceptre entrusted to him should lose none of its
authority by his remissness, and had no sooner restored peace within
the kingdom, than he set out against the more distant insurgents, whom
he soon reduced to obedience also. Paulo was taken prisoner at
Narbonne, together with the bulk of his adherents; at the intercession
of the Archbishop they were all pardoned, except Paulo himself, who was
found hidden in a cave.</p>
<p>When brought before him, Vamba said to him, &ldquo;I conjure you now
before God to tell me, have you any complaint against me, have I ever
done any thing to justify your revolt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you ask me in God&rsquo;s Name,&rdquo; replied Paulo,
&ldquo;I cannot but speak the truth. And I must therefore say, that
never have I received evil at your hands, but on the contrary signal
favours. I was always highly honoured by you, and it was the devil
<span class="corr" id="xd21e3909" title="Not in source">who</span> led
me astray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the king forgave him the penalty of death, but he had his eyes
put out, and took him captive to Toledo with a rope round his neck.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span></p>
<p>You might think that Vamba would have had peace, now that he had
subdued all his enemies, but it was not so; another noble, Erviga, rose
up against him and usurped his authority. By this time Vamba was old
and worn down with care. Sancha was dead, and his race seemed well-nigh
run. Erviga, though unjust in seeking to take the crown by force, was a
brave leader and had the qualities necessary for a good ruler,
therefore the good Vamba, instead of spending the blood of his subjects
in fighting for a position which he had so little strength left to
maintain, settled the question by retiring into a monastery and
recommending the people to accept the rule of Erviga. <span class=

<h2 class="main">DO&Ntilde;A TEREA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Alfonso the Fifth of Leon was but an infant when his
father&rsquo;s death laid on him the charge of resisting the advance of
the Moslem, which was the inheritance of all Spanish sovereigns for so
many centuries. His mother, Elvira, ruled the kingdom during his
minority with great prudence and courage, defeated the Infidels in
several encounters, and cultivated in her son all the qualities of a
great sovereign. So well did her instructions prosper, that at the age
of fifteen he was called to reign in his own name; and from the
seclusion of a convent, whither she retired when the country no longer
required her, his mother had frequent occasion to return thanks to
heaven for the noble qualities her boy exhibited. For many years he
continued the pride of the nation and the dread of its enemies;
prosperity blessed the people at home, and their borders were
continually enlarged by the success of his arms. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>Success, though pleasant, is not always good. Alfonso, under its
influence, at one time grew heedless of the dictates of his religion.
On one occasion, being about to conclude a treaty of peace with
Andalla, the Moorish king of Toledo, that prince asked the hand of his
sister, Do&ntilde;a Terea, as one of the conditions of the treaty. The
king&rsquo;s counsellors were struck with horror, at the thought of
handing over a Christian maiden to an Infidel husband, the people
expressed their indignation aloud, and Do&ntilde;a Terea herself
implored piteously to be spared.</p>
<p>As I have said, success had spoiled Alfonso&rsquo;s nature; he was
so accustomed to succeed in every thing, that he could not bear to be
crossed even by righteous counsel. It seemed something fine to do what
every one else was afraid of; he would not show himself so weak, not
he. He would give his sister to the Moorish king in spite of them all,
and show them he was superior to their prejudices. Besides, he further
justified it to himself, because Andalla undertook on this condition to
help him in his campaign against the other Moorish kings; forgetting
that we must never do a wrong action for the sake of any advantageous
result we may fancy it will bring.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Terea, on the other hand, felt the full misery of her
situation. No specious arguments blinded <i>her</i>. She felt it both
wrong and repugnant; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230"
name="pb230">230</a>]</span>and besides, there was many a gallant,
handsome knight ready to risk his life to win her love, and on whom she
might have bestowed it in joy to herself and without violence to her
conscience. Too young to have fixed her choice, she still had her
secret preference dearly nursed, but not yet acknowledged so as to give
the object of it the right to stand forth as her defender.</p>
<p>Now, a blight was over all her hopes; her bridal day, instead of an
occasion of hope and gladness, was to be a day of desolation and
despair. The prelates and great men of the kingdom offered themselves
willingly to represent her grief to the king; but they could not move
him, and when he sent the envoy who was to conduct her to Toledo, she
was found in an agony on her knees, imploring deliverance from on High.
Even this, however, did not move the king&rsquo;s heart; and poor
Do&ntilde;a Terea was dragged off, more dead than alive, to be the
Moor&rsquo;s bride.</p>
<p>Her beautiful golden hair&mdash;a romance of the time particularly
records the tint&mdash;hung untended over her shoulders; the colour had
fled from her tear-worn cheeks, and the expression from her
dark-glancing eyes; for it seemed as if God, on whom she called so
passionately to deliver her, had forsaken her in her hour of need.</p>
<p>And thus she was brought to Andalla, King of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>Toledo, who was too much pleased to have a
beautiful Christian maiden for his bride to listen to her appeal to his
magnanimity to release her. But when she found that all her gentle
supplications were of no avail, she seemed suddenly inspired with a
fire of queenly indignation; and, assuming a commanding attitude, she
said solemnly, &ldquo;Moor, of another law far removed from mine, know
that I desire not to be united with thee, and thy presence is a burden
to me; but if thou art sacrilegiously determined to marry me against my
will, know that we Christians each at our baptism have a guardian angel
given to us, to defend us from the power of evil; and so sure as thou
respectest not the difference there is between thy belief and mine,
that guardian spirit shall vindicate me and smite thee with his
two-edged sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Andalla only thought this exhibition of indignation made her
look prettier; and laughing at the threatened visitation, persisted in
making her his wife. His neighbours counted him singularly lucky in the
possession of such a prize; and he thought himself happy indeed.
Nevertheless, from the day of his marriage, a strange illness had
assailed him. Though still in the prime of manhood, an unaccountable
weakness overtook him; first his sight failed, and then his hearing,
then his taste, then his strength; and all the clever physicians of the
Moorish dominions failed, not only to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>give him any relief,
but even to guess at the cause of the malady.</p>
<p>Driven thus to think within himself, he recalled the solemn warning
of Do&ntilde;a Terea, and fear overtook him that her words were coming
true. The moment he realized his danger, he sent for her and asked her
if she still wished to return to her own country; to which she of
course replied, that it was what she must always most desire. So he
summoned the most honourable men of his kingdom, and gave Do&ntilde;a
Terea in charge to them, and sent them to convey her back to her own
country; and, moreover, put in their hands priceless presents of gold
and precious stones, to make amends in the best way in his power, and
also to testify that he did it to satisfy the scruples of the princess,
and not out of any disrespect to the Christian king, of whose religion
he now stood in great fear.</p>
<p>And Alfonso the Fifth, what became of him? Had he heard the Moorish
king&rsquo;s embassage, he too might have been brought to the knowledge
of his error, and to repentance; but when it arrived at the capital of
Leon, he was already gone out on an expedition in which, by his unholy
alliance, the infidel forces were mingled with his own. In high
spirits, they marched along, crossing the Douro, fearing no opposition,
for the Moorish population was at the time divided by many internecine
feuds, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>and were hence precluded from assembling against
him in any large numbers. Thus he came to Viseo, a strong place
defended by a considerable garrison. Alfonso determined to lay siege to
it. The army was accordingly encamped before it, and wise measures for
its reduction promulgated, for Alfonso was a skilful general. Never
doubting of his luck, however, he neglected those precautions which
would have suggested themselves to a less successful man. The weather
was sultry, and the heavy armour irksome. Alfonso, unused to restraint,
heedlessly cast his cuirass aside, yet, with his accustomed bravery,
showed himself under the walls as before, too self-confident to listen
to counsel.</p>
<p>A sharp-eyed Moor upon the battlements detected the advantage he had
given to his enemies, and letting fly a poisoned arrow aimed with the
nice precision which the greatness of the venture inspired, gave him a
mortal wound.</p>
<p>Thus he was cut down in early manhood, and the care of the kingdom
once more left in the hands of an infant.</p>
<p>But Do&ntilde;a Terea reached home in peace; and passed the rest of
her days praying for the brother who had so sadly wronged her, in the
Convent of Las Huelgas&mdash;one of the present architectural glories
of Spain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I was born in Venice the renowned. When I had
completed my twenty Aprils, my father called me to him one day, and
said to me, &ldquo;Dear son, I have overflowing wealth of possessions,
and in silver and gold twenty thousand doubloons fully told; you are my
only heir, and I am infirm and stricken in years. I am thinking of
selling the good ship, that even now lies anchored in port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I replied, &ldquo;Father and lord, observe, the
possessions, silver and gold, may all in an instant be reduced to
nothing. But freight the good ship now with rich merchandise and wares
which shall profit in exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after this, I sailed forth in the good ship, well
freighted with precious stores; her linen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>sails filled out with
the soft wind, and her keel ploughing the <i lang=
"es">berdinegros</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3977src" href=
"#xd21e3977" name="xd21e3977src">2</a> waters of the crystal main.</p>
<p>Thus to Tunis we came, where my affairs succeeded prosperously. My
merchandise was all disposed of to great advantage in a short time, and
before leaving the port I wandered forth to see the town. Passing by
one of the great public squares, I saw some Turkish sentinels walking
up and down, guarding a dead body; I addressed them, asking why they
did not inter it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;he was of the Christian
people, and in his days of life traded with his ship, wherefore a Turk
of great consideration in our city, and a friend of his, entrusted to
him a thousand ducats in silver, with which he bought great provision
of cloth, and sent his servants to trade with it, while he remained in
Tunis. The ship left the port with a prosperous wind, but before four
days were out, a <i lang="es">balandra</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3989src" href="#xd21e3989" name="xd21e3989src">3</a> came in,
bearing the news that the ship had been overtaken by a tempest, and all
the merchandise had gone down into the boiling deep. With that the
Christian merchant was so overcome, that he fainted and fell down dead,
and we hold his body in bail for the thousand ducats he owed the
Turk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I replied, &ldquo;I will pay the sum you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>have
named.&rdquo; And then, taking the body on my shoulders, I carried it
to the church of Serafic Francis, which there is in Tunis, to give it
burial, and paid the stipend of the priest who should say a hundred
masses for the soul&rsquo;s rest. Then I returned to pay the debt to
the Turk.</p>
<p>Scarcely had I passed the threshold of his house, when I heard the
sound of great wailing and lamentation, as of one taking leave of
life.</p>
<p>So I turned and asked two turbaned renegades who stood in waiting,
what meant the wail. And they said, &ldquo;There came to Tunis a female
slave, a captive Christian, causing envy to all the womanhood of this
place, so beauteously had Heaven arrayed her. Her our master bought,
with the intention of making her recant and marrying her. But she said
to him, &lsquo;<i lang="es">Se&ntilde;or</i>, it is vain you weary
yourself, to persuade me to do this thing, for never will I deny my God
and His laws, though to lay down my life I am ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the master heard this he was wroth, and taking her by
the shoulders let her down into a <i lang="es">mazmorra</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4007src" href="#xd21e4007" name="xd21e4007src">4</a>
under his house, binding her with a heavy chain, and feeding her day by
day with but six ounces of coarse bread and half a pint of
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing that, I said I would buy the maid, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>redeem her; but they answered it was vain. The
Turk would not part with her to any one, and in mockery he had set her
price at a hundred millions. So I saw I must have recourse to
stratagem, and asked accordingly whether the maid had declared herself
a Christian, and they answered, &ldquo;No, she had only spoken of her
God and of His law,&rdquo; then, while I bethought me how to arrange my
plan, they exclaimed suddenly, &ldquo;Here comes the master;&rdquo; and
the moment that he entered the house, eagerly prostrating themselves at
his feet, they said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great lord of this mighty <i lang=
"es">alc&aacute;zar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4019src" href=
"#xd21e4019" name="xd21e4019src">5</a>, behold a man who comes to pay
the debt of the dead Christian, and who is also desirous to buy the
maiden, the slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was I sorry to find myself thus launched into the middle of the
business, but I stood perplexed, praying in my own mind that God would
give me some well-conceived idea which should serve for the redemption
of the maiden.</p>
<p>Meantime, I counted out the sum that was due from the dead man; and
then I said, &ldquo;Know you that this Mustafa, my sister, whom you
keep in your <i lang="es">mazmorra</i>, feeding her with the bread of
affliction, is the most pious Jewess of our nation, and that in this
you do a great wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could proceed no further, for the Moors think <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>it a
terrible discredit to have any Jew within their precincts; and this one
flew into an ungovernable rage at the bare idea that he had been
harbouring one; plucking out his beard by handfuls, he cried out with a
loud voice of desolation,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me, for my fame and my honour before my people is
gone, now that I have suffered this scum of the earth to be with me!
Let her be thrust forth from my gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So his servants ran and took her up, more dead than alive, and
putting her into my arms drove us forth with ignominy and
imprecations.</p>
<p>I was no sooner in the street, than I gave great thanks to God for
the rescue He had provided, and then I bore her along to the church,
thinking she needed the rites of sepulture; but I had scarcely entered
the sacred place, than she opened her eyes and breathed. So I gave her
such means of refreshment as I had about me, and by degrees the sad
lady came to herself; and to give her greater consolation, I bid her
observe she was no longer in the estate of a slave, but that by the
mercy of Heaven she was redeemed and free.</p>
<p>As soon as her strength had begun to return, I deemed it prudent to
run no risk of danger from the Turk, and therefore used every possible
diligence to conduct her to the harbour, where at once we went down
into my good ship, and giving the crew word to get to sea with all
despatch, we were soon steering swiftly between two azure fields.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus we came to Venice, my country, where I found that during my
absence my dear old father had died; and I should well-nigh have died
of sorrow too, but that I had the charge of the beautiful captive lady
upon me, and I had to provide for her welfare.</p>
<p>One day I took her aside, and asked her respectfully to tell me what
country she was of, and who were her people; but she shook her head in
a melancholy way, and bid me ask her nothing, but that with time I
should learn all her eventful history. For she came from a far country,
and she was not bold enough to propose to me the travail and peril of
bearing her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;most beauteous Diana, I asked
the question that in the end I might have become thy beloved husband,
and if I am not worthy to know thy country, what shall become of my
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she&mdash;&ldquo;From this day I will be thy beloved wife, for
it is thus meet that love should be paid with love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I heard this answer, I was beside myself with joy, and
instantly arranged every thing for the marriage festival, which was
celebrated with great pomp and rejoicing, <i lang=
"es">ca&ntilde;as</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4055src" href=
"#xd21e4055" name="xd21e4055src">6</a> and <i lang=
"es">alcanc&iacute;as</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4060src" href=
"#xd21e4060" name="xd21e4060src">7</a>, music, jousts, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>dancing. Among the people who collected from all
parts to enjoy the sports, was the captain of one of the ships in port,
and he fastened himself on to me with every exterior token of
friendship: I too was taken with him, and we were soon inseparable.
Nothing would satisfy him, but that one fair bright morning when our
f&ecirc;tes were over, we should come down to this vessel that he might
give us a banquet there.</p>
<p>After this there was dancing, and singing, and much merry-making;
and while we were enchanted with the dulcet tones of the marvellous
instruments his minstrels played, we failed to perceive we were being
carried out to sea.</p>
<p>It was about six in the evening when my beloved bride came and took
me by the hand, and said, &ldquo;Without doubt there is some perfidy,
for my heart is filled with fear, and my soul is troubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I took her hand, thinking to reassure her by taking her on shore.
But when we came upon the deck, there was nothing to be seen all around
but sea and sky, and sea and sky.</p>
<p>My bride, when she saw that, fell into my arms in a swoon; and the
cruel captain and half-a-dozen of his men urged by his command, fell
upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>me, and tore her from me, and cast me into the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Holy Virgin of Carmel,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and thou S.
Anthony of Padua, and Santa Barbara the glorious, and thou my guardian
angel, pray for me now, that I perish not in this dire
distress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I uttered this petition, I felt a plank of wood strike against my
breast; and on it I skimmed the waters all night, and by the first
streak of dawn merciful Heaven commanded the waves to throw me upon a
soft sandy shore. I could not refrain from kissing the ground which
brought me safety; and as I rose up again, I beheld a holy hermit
coming towards me, who led me to a little hut, where every day he
brought me a basket of sufficient food.</p>
<p>At the end of six months, the hermit came to me very early one
morning, and bid me go stand upon the shore, for there a vessel awaited
me in which my passage-money was paid.</p>
<p>At the shore I found the vessel, and embarked as the hermit had
directed me, not knowing whither we were bound.</p>
<p>At last, after six months&rsquo; sailing, we came opposite the coast
of Ireland, and as we drew near shore, &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; said the
captain, &ldquo;it is necessary that this letter and this folded paper
be taken to the illustrious King of Ireland; which of you will
undertake the charge?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=
"#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span></p>
<p>The crew answered, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Se&ntilde;or</i>, let the
Venetian take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I, having no aim before me, cheerfully undertook the commission;
and springing on shore, went straight to the royal palace, where I
found myself in presence of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s majesty, into whose
august hands I delivered the folded paper.</p>
<p>This having opened, he read aloud these
words:&mdash;&ldquo;Illustrious Lord! most powerful King of Ireland,
the bearer of this letter is a physician of great renown; the sickness
of thy daughter, which none can cure, shall flee away at the very sight
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I was troubled, and would have explained to the King how I was
no physician, and the way in which the lot had fallen upon me to bring
the letter, which might equally have fallen on the most ignorant
sea-boy aboard; and in truth I knew no more of medicaments than the
lowest sea-boy of them all.</p>
<p>But the King was overjoyed at the prospect of the healing of his
daughter, and would listen to no explanations. And in proportion as he
manifested his joy, my dismay increased, for I feared his anger when
the undeception came.</p>
<p>Meantime, at his command, I was ushered into a vast hall, where were
assembled a thousand lords. But, gentle reader, you will well believe
me, it was not upon one of them I looked, for at first entering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>my eye lighted upon a casket covered with
emeralds and brilliants which I had given to my beloved bride on the
day of our espousals.</p>
<p>I threw myself upon it, crying, &ldquo;Beautiful Isabela! Ah! where
art thou? Where art thou mourning over my grief, as I mourn over
thine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, who lay sunk down in the depths of her white couch, at hearing
these words darted up from it, and flinging her arms round me, embraced
me.</p>
<p>I knew her as our lips met; and full of a thousand joys, we sat
talking over the past, forgetful of all present.</p>
<p>And first, I asked what had become of the wicked captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I told my father what he
had done, he sent and had him put to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;did I not tell you that
time would reveal to you all about my history? For now that you have
seen who and where I am, there is little left to tell. While I was yet
little more than a child, my father would have married me against my
inclination to a prince of Scotland; and I, knowing his intention, went
out from the palace in the night, disguised, upon a swift mare, and
when I had ridden a long way, I came to the sea-coast. I found a ship
into which, thoughtless child, I sought refuge, only caring to get away
from the prince of Scotland. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were corsairs who manned the vessel; and they
carried me off with them to Tunis, where you found me, and set me free
from that terrible suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While we were talking, the king came up; and as I was yet musing on
the marvellous direction of Providence, by which the lot had fallen on
me, rather than another, to come on the embassage to the palace,
without which I had been like never again to have met my bride, it fell
into my mind that I had yet the letter to give to his Majesty, which
having reached to him, he read thus aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I rest in holy ground, my soul at peace, is due to thee;
therefore, when the perfidious captain threw thee into the deep sea, I
was there; I provided the plank which carried thee to shore; I was the
hermit that received and nourished thee; I was captain of the ship that
brought thee to Ireland. And now live long with thy good spouse, and
rest after many misfortunes, even as I rest in the eternal
habitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I knew that it was the soul of him I buried at Tunis that had
thus befriended me.</p>
<p>Not very long after this the king died, and all the people acclaimed
me as their sovereign, where I have been reigning ever since, full of
happiness and glory. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"

<h2 class="main">EL CONDE FERNAN GONZALEZ.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Conde Fernan Gonzalez was a bold lance. Restless as
brave; when not engaged in chasing the Moors, he kept his appetite for
noble exploits whetted with the dangers of the chase.</p>
<p>One day, the furious course of a wild boar, and his own impetuosity
in the pursuit, led him far away from his companions, and the hills and
leafy oaks of Lara soon hid him from sight. On went the boar, and on
went the <i>Conde</i> after him, till, in the thickest of the forest,
the brute took refuge in a hermit&rsquo;s cell long deserted and
forgotten, and overgrown with ivy. The trees grew so close round the
spot, that the horse could not go through for the low interlacing
branches, so Gonzalez dismounted, taking his sword in his hand, and
wrapping his cloak round his arm by way of shield<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4144src" href="#xd21e4144" name="xd21e4144src">1</a>. Cutting his
way through to the low doorway, he found the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>boar
lying panting at the foot of a little altar which was there.</p>
<p>The good Count would not hurt the animal under such circumstances,
so he put up his sword into the sheath, and, before he turned to go,
knelt to offer up a prayer upon the sacred spot.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he knelt, there appeared before him a vision of the
former inhabitant of the place. He was a venerable man, dressed in
white, with bald head and a long grey beard, his feet were bare and he
leant upon a crook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good <i>Conde</i> Fernan Gonzales,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;Behold, the King Almanzor<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4158src"
href="#xd21e4158" name="xd21e4158src">2</a> is even now preparing to
come out to meet thee. Now, go out and give him battle, and be of good
heart; for though thou shalt be badly wounded, and the infidels shall
spill much of thy blood, yet shall a hundred of them fall for one of
thine. God guard thee, <i>Conde</i>, and that which thou shalt do this
day shall resound throughout all Spain. But this sign must come to pass
first; and when it is fulfilled do not lose courage, for all that are
with thee shall be stricken with fear and ready to flee away; but only
stand thou fast, and the day shall be given thee. After that shall come
days of peace; and a good wife shall be given thee, who shall be called
Sancha. And now return to Lara, for thy people are seeking thee
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>with fear and anxiety; and when these things
come to pass, remember the hermit who foretold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, without answering him a word, the good Count rose from his
knees, and, mounting his horse, rode back to Lara. There he found his
people, all running hither and thither in search of him. But he,
without telling them what had befallen, ranged them in order of battle,
and went out to meet King Almanzor.</p>
<p>Thus they went their way, and sure enough they were none too soon;
for even<a id="xd21e4170" name="xd21e4170"></a> as the hermit had said,
King Almanzor was on his way to meet him.</p>
<p>When the followers of Gonzalez saw the host that was marching
towards them, they were stricken with fear, for they were but a
handful. But Gonzalez, seeing their disorder, turned and said to them,
&ldquo;It is a shame, noble Castilian knights, to flee at sight of an
infidel host; for who is there that can stand against our banner and
our arms? At them! my friends, at them! Let there be not one of us
wanting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he set spurs to his charger, and rode into the midst of
the Moors; and he did so valiantly, that all his followers dashed into
them with like impetuosity, and none could stand before them; and for
one of them that was slain, a hundred of the infidels lay stretched
upon the ground. But the good <i>Conde</i> was wounded, and his blood
was poured out upon the ground; yet they pushed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>their way into the camp, where they found much
precious spoil.</p>
<p>And when they divided the treasure, Gonzalez remembered the hermit,
and set aside a portion of his share; and with it he built the church
of San Pedro de Arlanza. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=

<h2 class="main">THE FIRST TUNNY FISHING.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a fisherman named Pepe; he was very
good, and very poor. He never went out to fish without first kneeling
down and asking a blessing on his labours; he never lost his time in
drinking-bouts; he brought his children up to be as honest and
industrious as himself; yet nothing prospered with him. He toiled the
livelong day, and often far into the night, yet he could scarcely earn
enough to keep his family above want. If ever there was a storm, it was
sure to be Pepe&rsquo;s boat that would be swamped. And if ever there
was a rich shoal of fish came within his ordinary fishing-ground, it
would be sure to happen when he was ill, or his gear was out of order,
or when, for some reason, he could not avail himself of the
blessing.</p>
<p>What was most remarkable was, that under all this misfortune Pepe
was always cheerful. As the beautiful Spanish proverb says, he was like
the sandal-wood, perfuming the axe which strikes it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>low<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4193src" href=
"#xd21e4193" name="xd21e4193src">1</a>. He not only never complained,
and continued at his toil steadily day by day, but he was always
praising God for what He had given him&mdash;his wife, his children,
his humble hut, his strong arms. &ldquo;Put your trust in God, and your
feet diligently along the road<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4196src"
href="#xd21e4196" name="xd21e4196src">2</a>;&rdquo; so he used to say,
and so he used to act.</p>
<p>One day he had gone out as usual, and, as often happened, had taken
nothing. It was no use going back with an empty bag; he persevered
another day, and another, though he had nothing but a loaf to live on.
The sun above was like a furnace, the sea below like a lake of fire.
Pepe crept under the shadow of his sails, and was so exhausted with
heat and hunger that he fell into a swoon.</p>
<p>He saw himself lying at the bottom of his boat, but not alone. There
was One lying there also, who slept too. His raiment glistened, and a
light of glory surrounded Him, which paled that of the blazing sun. By
and by the sun went down, and it seemed that night came on, but He was
still there; and the wind rose, and Pepe&rsquo;s little boat was tossed
and buffeted, and Pepe was ready to cry out with alarm. Then he
thought, &ldquo;While He is here, no harm can come; I will keep His
slumber sacred.&rdquo; So he looked out on the fury of the storm, and
waited. Then that shining One arose <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>and waved His hands
abroad towards the winds, and there came a sweet melody from His mouth,
which said, &ldquo;Peace! peace!&rdquo; Then suddenly all was still and
bright again, and the soft breeze echoed back the music of
&ldquo;Peace! peace!&rdquo; Then Pepe, when he saw what He had done,
fell on his knees before Him, and said, &ldquo;Lord, as Thou hast done
this, send me now a draft of fishes, that my net may be full.&rdquo;
Then the Bright One stretched out His hands over the sea; and there
rose out of the rippling waves great handsome fishes such as Pepe had
never seen the like. They were of the height of a man in length, and
their skin shone like silver interwoven with many colours, and their
fins of gold. Docile at His gesture, they rose gently over the side of
the boat, and laid them obedient at His feet. One by one, on they came
till&mdash;appalling sight!&mdash;the boat began to sink under their
priceless weight.</p>
<p>For one moment Pepe&rsquo;s heart almost fainted within him at
seeing the rich prize sink away again just as it was within grasp, and
with it his boat, his tackle, all that he had to call his own! But his
eye rested on the Bright One who stood there, and his faith and
confidence returned. He observed that some folds of His glistening
mantle, as it hung loosely from His shoulders, floated on the waves
which were now meeting over the place where he stood. Confident that it
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>bear him up, Pepe stepped on to it, as on to dry
land, while all his earthly treasure sunk out of sight.</p>
<p>Then Pepe woke. The sun had nearly set; a light breeze was gently
carrying off the superfluous heat of the day; but his bark was empty,
no Bright One sat in it, no beautiful fish lay there. Pepe listlessly
looked over the side of his boat; the influence of his dream was yet
upon him, and he could not restrain a look after his sunken prize. What
was that? Something large and shining swam under his boat, surely!
Hastily Pepe detached a little lamp which always burnt under a cross
hung on the mast, and looked down into the clear blue waters, when lo!
as if attracted by the light, the shining fish turned their small
bright eyes towards it, as if they took the unwonted light for the
rising sun, and swam straight at it almost within arm&rsquo;s length.
Pepe was now at no loss what to do. Taking a large hook which lay in
the bottom of his boat, he lashed it firmly to a long spar, and then
hanging the lamp over the side of the boat, he prepared to seize the
finny prey with his improvised harpoon. The lamp attracted them as
before, and now came the struggle. Pepe was a small man, and the first
fish he tackled was a foot taller than himself and well-nigh pulled him
over the side of his boat. Pepe was glad enough to let him go, even at
the cost of his weapon, which the fish <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>carried down into the
deep with him. Pepe was, as you know by now, one who never lost heart;
he pulled out his <i lang="es">narvaja</i> (or long-bladed knife with a
cross-hilt), and tied it to another long piece of wood. Pepe was
gaining experience; this time he selected a smaller antagonist, and
great was his joy when, after a brief encounter, he landed him safely
in the bottom of the boat. Pepe was not avaricious, more anxious to
share the good news with his family than to obtain a large haul, he
only waited to take one moderate-sized fish more, and then he was off
to his home.</p>
<p>Great was the joy in the village next morning, as the news of the
new source of industry spread. Some were frightened, and said there
must be witchcraft in it; but when they saw the trade prosper, they
were glad enough to take it as the good gift of God, and from that time
to this the Tunny fishery has never failed to enrich the dwellers on
all the shores of the Mediterranean. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the days when our Lord walked on earth, it happened
that one night He and St. Peter found themselves far from any city or
village, on a bleak and desolate plain. Weary and footsore, it was with
great delight St. Peter descried at last a light from a woodman&rsquo;s
cot. &ldquo;Lord, let us rest here, let us pass the night under this
shelter,&rdquo; said St. Peter.</p>
<p>They knocked at the woodman&rsquo;s door; he was a good-hearted old
man, and he welcomed the belated travellers with no grudging greeting.
He heaped up the dry fagots and made the hut shine like a gilded palace
with that brilliant blaze which no wood throws out like that of the
olive-root; and such humble fare as he had he set before them without
stint.</p>
<p>The bleak wind moaned without, through the <span class=

"#xd21e4235" name="xd21e4235src">2</a>, and rattled the ill-fitting
door. But presently, above the moaning of the wind and the clatter of
the planks, they heard a hand knocking outside. The woodman opened, and
was rather taken aback to find two more wayfarers at the door.
&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said St. Peter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only some
of our people, it&rsquo;s all right, &lsquo;Where one can dine, two can
dine.&rsquo;&rdquo; A little embarrassed, the woodman scratched his
head, as he thought of the slenderness of his stores, but made no
opposition, and the strangers passed in. The wind moaned on, and
another knocking came. The woodman opened, and found two more guests
standing without. St. Peter, who had fancied he heard the soft voice of
St. John murmuring a favourite canticle as he passed, rose to see who
it was, and soon recognized the waving hair of gold of the youngest
Apostle. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said St. Peter, &ldquo;let them in,
they belong to our party too, &lsquo;Where one can dine, two can
dine.&rsquo;&rdquo; The woodman, more and more puzzled, stood by and
let them pass. He had hardly sat down when another knock was heard
above the storm. With his habitual readiness, the woodman opened, and
found two more strangers begging admittance. St. Peter, who seemed to
have a natural aptitude for the office of doorkeeper, once more
encouraged him to let them in, assuring him they all belonged to the
same party; and after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href=
"#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>another knock, the number of the
Apostolic college was complete.</p>
<p>The woodman looked wistfully at the empty table. He was the most
hospitable of woodmen, and gave his last crumb without a grudge; but he
was aghast at the thought that for the thirteen guests who had honoured
his roof, there was not sufficient to help round; and he slunk away
quite ashamed at the apparent but unavoidable stint.</p>
<p>Then He who first came in with St. Peter, rose and gave thanks, then
broke the bread and passed it round, and called on the woodman to come
and take his place among them. With fear and trembling the woodman sat
down, and with fear and trembling he saw his few barley-loaves and his
few grapes and fruits pass round and round till all were filled, and
there remained over and above to them that had eaten a larger provision
than he had ever seen under his roof before; but he durst not ask
<i>who</i> was his guest, knowing it must be the Lord.</p>
<p>Then they lay down and slept, each wrapped in his travelling mantle,
and in the blaze of the olive-root fire. In the morning when they rose
to depart, the woodman, alarmed at what he had seen the night before,
durst not ask them whither they went, but let them depart in silence.
St. Peter, however, remained behind, and after thanking him for his
hospitality, told him to ask what boon he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>would, and he would
grant it. The woodman was a man of few wants, and after he had thought
a minute, he answered that he was content with his humble lot; he did
not want it changed. His only amusement was now and then a game at
cards, when the season of wood-felling or any other chance brought an
accession of companions to his hut for a few nights; and it would be a
pleasure if he might always win whenever he played.</p>
<p>St. Peter looked grave; he did not much like giving an encouragement
to card-playing; but then he considered the poor fellow&rsquo;s
irreproachable character, his life of privations, and moreover his own
unconditioned promise to grant his request, and finally, that each
success, while it would do no harm to the well-regulated old man, would
serve as a discouragement to all the other players; so he ended by
giving his consent, only reserving one condition, that he should never
play for stakes sufficiently high to injure his companions; and then
hasted on to join the rest of his party, who had made some way while he
was parleying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fortune is certainly for those to whom she
comes,&rsquo;&rdquo; moralized the woodman when he was left alone,
&ldquo;&lsquo;and not for those who seek her<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4255src" href="#xd21e4255" name="xd21e4255src">3</a>.&rsquo; How
many are there who would have given their ears for such a chance as I
have had to-day; and it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>given to me, who, being already
gifted with content, want for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time passed on, and the woodman, being a just man, never abused the
favour he had received, which however served, by the satisfaction which
success <span class="corr" id="xd21e4262" title=
"Source: alway">always</span> confers, to cheer his solitary life. At
last the time came when the measure of his days was full; and resigning
his spirit to the care of his Lord, it was carried by his angel to the
realms above.</p>
<p>Now, all through his life it had rankled in his mind that he might
have made a better and less selfish use of the gift St. Peter had
bestowed on him, when now, for the first time, it occurred to him how
to apply it. Then he turned to his angel, and begged him to stop on his
way, at the bedside of the first poor dying man they passed whose soul
was most in danger of being lost. The angel, who descried some
charitable design in the request, bore him to a room in a great city
where an <i lang="es">escribano</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4269src"
href="#xd21e4269" name="xd21e4269src">4</a> lay at the last gasp. The
demon of avarice sat on his pillow, straining to clutch the passing
soul, while his young son and a clergyman knelt beside him, entreating
him to be reconciled to God. &ldquo;Caramba!&rdquo; exclaimed the
woodman, &ldquo;surely, our Lord died for all, without even excluding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span><i lang="es">escribanos</i>!&rdquo; As the good
angel hovered over the bed, a gentle sleep fell on the dying man, and
the demon relaxed his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; said the woodman, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do
any thing while the man&rsquo;s asleep, let&rsquo;s have a game at
cards to wile away the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said the
demon, for cards being invented by his crew, he thought himself safe to
win; &ldquo;but how shall we manage about the stakes? You see
you&rsquo;ve had to leave your pocket behind you, so how will you pay
me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stake you something better than
money,&rdquo; replied the woodman. &ldquo;What say you to staking my
soul, which is on its way to glory, against this
<i>escribano&rsquo;s</i> soul, of which at best you are only three
parts sure?&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the demon, who thought
it one of the best chances he had ever had.</p>
<p>The woodman let him cut and shuffle and play what tricks he liked
with the pack, secure of his success; and in less than half an hour his
triumph was secure. The demon could not believe his eyes, but could
not, either, deny his defeat; so, putting his tail between his legs, he
laid his ears back<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4284src" href=
"#xd21e4284" name="xd21e4284src">5</a> and disappeared through the
floor, quite ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>While this was going on, the <i lang="es">escribano</i> had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>awoke from his refreshing sleep; freed from the
solicitations of the demon of avarice, he no longer refused the
ministrations of the minister of the Church, but had expressed his
contrition for the sins of the past, and was ready to depart in peace
with God and all the world.</p>
<p>When the woodman arrived at the gate of Paradise, accompanied by the
soul of the <i lang="es">escribano</i>, St. Peter called
out<span class="corr" id="xd21e4301" title="Not in source">,</span>
&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; &ldquo;I, of the hut on the bleak
moor,&rdquo; replied the woodman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you I know,&rdquo; replied St. Peter; &ldquo;but you
don&rsquo;t come alone&mdash;who is that black soul with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Se&ntilde;or, I don&rsquo;t come alone, because I thought
God loved to see men in good fellowship. This poor soul is only black
because, being an <i lang="es">escribano</i>, some of his ink has stuck
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no admittance here for <i lang=
"es">escribanos</i>,&rdquo; replied St. Peter, &ldquo;so creep in
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Se&ntilde;or; but I said not so when you came to my hut
on the bleak moor and brought other twelve with you. Doesn&rsquo;t
&lsquo;Where one can dine, two can dine,&rsquo; hold good here
also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>St. Peter could not say nay, so he turned his back while the woodman
took up the soul of the <i lang="es">escribano</i> on his shoulders and
crept in under the shade of the eternal groves. <span class=

<h2 class="main">HORMESINDA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the period of the Moors&rsquo; most complete
dominion over Spain, Pelayo, the noble scion of her ancient kings,
stood almost alone in the defence of his country. Undismayed by the
misfortunes of his race and people, or by the oppressive rigours of the
conquerors, he never tired of rousing his brethren to a sense of their
shameful condition, and stirring them up to the desire of again
restoring their religion and the throne of their native rulers.</p>
<p>Meantime, his sister Hormesinda, no less ardent and patriotic, but
weaker and more short-sighted, had thought to benefit her people by
sealing a compromise with the invaders. Forgetful of the religious laws
which forbid such a union, she married Munuza, one of the Moorish
chiefs who reigned at Gijon, and for a few years imagined she had
effected wonders because she had induced the conqueror to mitigate his
oppressions.</p>
<p>Pelayo, however, was almost more distressed at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>the
contamination of his sister, married to an unbeliever, than by the
bondage of his fellow-countrymen; and being on the point of leading the
people he had collected to an attack on the Moorish Alc&aacute;zar, he
first obtained an interview with her, within the king&rsquo;s private
apartments, with the view of inducing her to abandon her infidel
lord.</p>
<p>Hormesinda, however, had chosen her path, and could not now escape
its leadings; the interview was both stormy and touching. Pelayo,
unflinching in his morality and patriotism, could find nothing to say
to her but words of reproach. And Hormesinda could only urge, that
though she might have been wrong in marrying the Moor, yet, now her
word, and life, and love were pledged to him, she could not leave
him.</p>
<p>Munuza despised the Christians, and so Pelayo had no difficulty in
gaining access to Hormesinda accompanied by the venerable Veremundo,
his father; but a Jew in Munuza&rsquo;s service having betrayed the
information that he had no less a person than Pelayo himself in his
power, he ordered him to be captured and thrown into a dismal dungeon
called a <i lang="es">mazmorra</i>.</p>
<p>No sooner did Munuza know that he had nothing to fear from Pelayo,
than it became evident his moderation towards the Christians had been
dictated less by Hormesinda&rsquo;s representations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>than
by dread of Pelayo&rsquo;s reprisals, for he now began to add to the
burdens of the conquered, without mercy. To crown all, he issued a
decree by which all who would not make themselves Mohammedans were
declared to be slaves.</p>
<p>This measure completed the indignation of the Christians; and when
it became known where Pelayo was held in durance, it needed but little
urging of Leandro, his brother, to lead the outraged population to the
assault of the Alc&aacute;zar of Gijon.</p>
<p>The impetuosity of the despairing population was irresistible.
Munuza, inclined to despise them at first, found himself surrounded
before he was aware, and sallied out with his reserve to give life to
his troops and repel the insurgents. He had no sooner left the
precincts of the palace than Hormesinda took advantage of the
circumstance to set free her brother, who was thus enabled to show
himself at the head of his people like a miraculous apparition,
inspiring them with courage to drive all before them.</p>
<p>Munuza, obliged to escape for his life, re-entered the
Alc&aacute;zar, where Hormesinda awaited him with feminine tenderness,
desirous only to make a bulwark of her body between him and
Pelayo&rsquo;s fury. Munuza, however, had doubtless courage, though it
was the courage of an infidel; and not only refused to owe his life to
the protection of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span>a woman, but recognizing that it was her
hand alone could have set his captive free, stabbed her and himself
just in time to die at the entering feet of Pelayo and his victorious
host.</p>
<p>This victory of the Christian arms was the first-fruits of many
others, which, hardly fought through succeeding centuries, restored at
last the whole of Spain to Christendom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">FILIAL LOVE BEFORE ALL.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the countless romantic chronicles of heroism
which form the basis of the popular literature of Spain, there are none
more multiplied or more interesting than those relating to the Cid Don
Rodrigo. His valorous services against the Moorish oppressors of his
country were never forgotten by its grateful people; and every
campaign, every act of his life became the theme of a chronicle or a
ballad. It is scarcely remarkable that one so noted for his dauntless
demeanour through life should have been a good and dutiful son in his
youth; nor that one of his most celebrated deeds was prompted by the
dictates of filial duty.</p>
<p>His father, Don Diego Lainez, was one of the most valiant knights of
King Fernando of Castille. The king valued the old man, and loved to
distinguish him with his special favour; but when he chose him for the
governor of the young prince his son, he did it not so much to secure
him the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>wisest counsellor of his kingdom as to honour
the old man before his people.</p>
<p>Now at King Fernando&rsquo;s court there was a noble, the Conde
Lozano, as valiant and celebrated as Don Diego, but far from possessing
his virtues.</p>
<p>Conde Lozano no sooner heard of Don Diego&rsquo;s elevation than his
heart was filled with rage and envy, which blinded his reason. Without
stopping to consider the folly and wickedness of the action, he
hastened to meet the venerable Don Diego, and loaded him with
vituperation. Don Diego, with Christian moderation, strove to appease
him.</p>
<p>Conde Lozano had a daughter who had all her life been the playmate
of Don Diego&rsquo;s son Rodrigo. Nothing could be more devoted than
the love of the two children for each other; and their union had been
long looked upon by both as only waiting their coming of due age for
its celebration.</p>
<p>This consideration Don Diego at last resorted to, thinking that the
Conde had only to be reminded of such a tie to staunch his indignation.
But it was far otherwise. &ldquo;Indeed no,&rdquo; he replied with
bitter irony, &ldquo;now that his father has received such a
distinguished position, the youth ought to have very different ideas.
There is nothing to which he may not aspire now; and his flight shall
certainly not be cut short by being tied to my poor
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not his father&rsquo;s position that can make
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>any difference in his prospects,&rdquo; firmly
responded Don Diego; &ldquo;he must win his own claim to honour by
defending his country against its invaders, as all his ancestors have
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Conde was in that state of unreasonable humour which takes
offence at every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His ancestors, indeed!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why do you
remind me of them? Have they done more than I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Spain speaks of their valour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Spain unjustly lavishes on them praise due to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king acknowledges it in the honour he has conferred on my
person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your old age, not your merit, that moved him; had he
thought of merit, he would have given the office to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best proof of where he considered merit to be, is seen by
looking where he conferred the reward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say, that I have <i>no</i> merit!&rdquo; cried
the Count, now losing all command of himself; and before Don Diego
could show him that was not what he had said, he dealt him a blow on
the face, and at the same time threw his sword on the ground, to show
that it was a premeditated affront, and he had done it rather than
afford him the satisfaction of a fair fight.</p>
<p>It is hardly possible in these days to realize the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>full
extent of such an insult. In the semi-barbarous code which a life of
continual warfare kept up, nothing but the life-blood of the offender
could wipe out such a stain. Rodrigo came in while his father was yet
chafing under the affront, which was not only regarded as personal, but
as an injury to his whole house and lineage. It needed only to tell
young Rodrigo, to rouse his choler, for the blood of his ancestors
flowed warm within him, and young as he was, he knew that upon him
devolved the duty of asserting the honour of his house. His father had
no need to urge him. &ldquo;You shall see, father, that I am not
unworthy of the blood I inherit from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is one thing I have to tell you; yet one thing,
which is like to cool your courage more than the fear of essaying your
first arms against a tried warrior. Know that he who, with the five
darts of his right hand, struck through the grey beard of my old age,
was none other than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me but his name, and I will smite him, whoever it may
be!&rdquo; interposed the impetuous youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was none other than Xim&eacute;na&rsquo;s
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shock, so unexpected, was almost more than Rodrigo could bear.
The mantling colour fled from his cheek. What were now to become of all
the hopes of his young life? Either he must suffer the affront to
remain a stain on the honour <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href=
"#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>of his house, or he must avenge
it, and for ever give up Xim&eacute;na. No! his father&rsquo;s honour
was before any other consideration. Whatever it might cost him, he
must, must assert <i>that</i>. And he hesitated no longer.</p>
<p>The Conde Lozano received him with all his superciliousness, asked
him what he wanted with him, called him a &ldquo;plucky little
boy,&rdquo; and bid him do what his &ldquo;dad&rdquo; had told him,
&ldquo;like a good child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rodrigo felt too deeply the force of his wrongs and sufferings to
have any heart to bandy words with him; he had come to demand
satisfaction, and, by his knightly honour, the Conde could not
refuse.</p>
<p>So they went out into the open, and drew their swords, leaving it to
God to declare the right, for indeed, &ldquo;the battle is not to the
strong;&rdquo; and so the sword of the stripling prevailed that day,
and the bold, proud man fell vanquished at his feet.</p>
<p>The lifeless body of her father was brought in to Xim&eacute;na.
Helpless and filled with horror, she hastened to the presence of the
king, to demand justice, little dreaming it was her Rodrigo she was
denouncing. The king, equally ignorant of Rodrigo&rsquo;s part in the
matter, readily promised it, and gave orders for the arrest of the
offender. But in the meantime Don Diego came in to denounce himself as
the instigator of the deed. In his own <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>manly way, he
detailed the provocation he had received and the prowess of his son,
and offered his own grey head in reparation, if the king judged that
blood so shed called for justice.</p>
<p>The king refused to decide a matter of so great moment without his
council, and put off considering the case till it should meet; meantime
Diego was suffered to go at large, on <i>parole</i> that he would not
leave Burgos.</p>
<p>The knight immediately sought out his gallant boy, whom he found
trying to make his peace with and console Xim&eacute;na; but
Xim&eacute;na would not be comforted. Only when he told her how
miserable he was, she consented to listen to him; and then he reasoned
with her, and asked her, Spaniard as he was, what <i>could</i> he have
done otherwise? Had he preferred his own love for her to his
father&rsquo;s honour, would she have smiled on him <i>then</i>? Would
she not have spurned him with contempt? She could not deny that. She
admired his filial love and bravery; but her loss was fresh upon her,
and she could not bear to see the sword which had executed her father
hanging by <i>his</i> side.</p>
<p>Then it was Don Diego came in; and the meeting between the aged
sire, proud of his noble son, and the son who had preferred filial duty
before every other consideration, was a touching one; but fate required
it should be brief. Don Diego was obliged to tear himself from his
arms, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>and advise his leaving Burgos immediately; for,
he said, &ldquo;prudent and pious as you are, it is well you should not
be taken; for when a man is taken and placed on trial, there is at
least an <i>idea</i> of guilt passes upon him. It is better, my son, to
avoid even this.&rdquo; And so he sent him to the wars and told him to
come back conqueror of the Moors, and the brightness of his fame should
thus disperse the cloud which now hung over him.</p>
<p>Rodrigo was loth to part from Xim&eacute;na without a sign of
reconciliation; but his father urged his immediate departure, and his
filial piety again prevailed. &ldquo;I hear and obey,&rdquo; he meekly
answered, and so he went to fight the Moors.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A year and a day had passed away, and Count Lozano was quite
forgotten, when all Burgos was set rejoicing at the deliverance which a
young knight had effected over the Moors.</p>
<p>The king was keeping high court, when one day the venerable Don
Diego came before him, bringing the standards which the young knight,
his son Rodrigo, had taken. He told of how he had overcome hardship and
peril, had cleared the roads of marauders, had fought his way up to
Celin, the Moorish King of M&eacute;rida, had called him to meet him in
single combat, had overcome him, and set free five Christian kings whom
he held in cruel chains. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>The narrative was received with joyful acclamations, the trumpets
sounded, and, at a sign from the king, admission was given to the
youthful hero, who threw himself at the monarch&rsquo;s feet. Fernando
raised him in his arms, and presented him with honour to his court. His
pardon was assured, and old Don Diego was radiant with joy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, there was a commotion in the assembly;
Xim&eacute;na demanded audience of the king. She had come to ask
whether any amount of honourable service could neutralize a sentence of
death incurred&mdash;and if not, why was Rodrigo treated with honour,
instead of being imprisoned as a criminal?</p>
<p>Now, Fernando could have explained to her the motives on which he
had acted&mdash;could have bid her remember how it was Conde Lozano who
had called down on himself the retribution he had suffered&mdash;could
have pointed out the dangers that surrounded the kingdom, and the need
in which it stood of men of fearless mind, such as Rodrigo; but, with
the wisdom of a Solomon, he took a line which was better than argument.
&ldquo;If such is your will, maiden,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have
nothing to say. You are the only living representative of the deceased
Conde: if you maintain your charge against him, it is not for me to
withstand it. Guards, lead Don Rodrigo to prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Diego, with all his fortitude, could not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>keep
himself from falling on his son&rsquo;s neck in an agony of despair.
Rodrigo himself was shaken by his father&rsquo;s grief. And all the
nobles gave signs of compassion at the misfortune of one so young and
brave.</p>
<p>Xim&eacute;na had kept herself proud and erect while the gladsome
welcome had sounded in her ears as an injury to Conde Lozano&rsquo;s
memory. But when she saw the scene of mourning around her, despair took
possession of her too, and she fell into Urraca the Infanta&rsquo;s
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because you would not take my advice, and look at
him,&rdquo; whispered Urraca. &ldquo;Had you looked on his noble face,
you never could have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it, and therefore I dared not look,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at him now,&rdquo; pleaded Urraca.</p>
<p>The guards were leading him out, and his head was bent to the
ground; but at that moment their eyes met, and both felt that he must
not die.</p>
<p>That night he was in his prison. She could not rest in her chamber:
the guard had respect for her orders, for she was an earl&rsquo;s
daughter, and he let her stand behind an arch where she could hear him
talking with his faithful esquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think no more of Xim&eacute;na,&rdquo; said the esquire:
&ldquo;she loves you not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, say not so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Wrong her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>not. I know she loved me, and she could not
change; therefore she loves me yet. As she was to me when I encountered
the Conde, so was I to her when she denounced me to the king; and in
what she has done to honour her father&rsquo;s memory, she has shown
her true nobility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be very grand,&rdquo; said the esquire, &ldquo;but it
is yet hard you should have to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard! Of what use would life be to me if Xim&eacute;na will
not be mine? I have only one use for it; and if she requires it of me,
it is a joy to yield it up at her behest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Xim&eacute;na heard him express so much devotion for her, and
judge her so justly and tenderly, she could bear to hear no more, lest
her tears should betray her. She withdrew to her chamber, but could not
sleep; but when her tired eyelids, weary with watching, closed, there
seemed to come a sweet, soft voice, as of an angel, which spoke of
pardon and forgiveness, and of mercy more sweet than justice. And
before her eyes there floated visions of terrible Moorish hordes
encompassing her native land, spreading fire and sword over its smiling
plains; and there rode out against them a single youth, clad in bright
armour, and wherever he raised his flashing sword the ranks of the
enemy gave way and fled before him.</p>
<p>And when the morning light came in, and chased these phantasms away,
she rose and went to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>king, and asked the liberation of
him whose condemnation she had sought yesterday.</p>
<p>Then the king saw that his stratagem had answered well, and that he
had done right to trust to her woman&rsquo;s heart. So he ordered
Rodrigo to be brought forth, and pronounced him free. And then he
joined their hands and gave them to each other, and told them they were
worthy of each other, for each had preferred a father&rsquo;s honour
before the love of their own heart; and now it was his royal will that
they should forget the past, and live for each other in the future.

<h2 class="main">RAGUEL;<br>
OR,<br>
THE JEWESS OF TOLEDO.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Alfonso VIII., King of Castille, succeeded to his
throne in troublous times. His native country was overrun and
subjugated by a people alien in nationality and religion, and his own
particular dominions were a prey to civil dissensions, which had
gathered strength during his minority. The Pope, Innocent III., seeing
how he was beset, had called on other Christian nations to assist him
in resisting the encroachments of the Moors; and these auxiliaries had
unhappily shown themselves disorderly and rapacious, wasting the
territory they had come to protect. By his prudence, Alfonso found the
means to remedy all these disorders in turn. His French, German, and
English allies he dismissed to their own homes without involving
himself in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>any quarrel with them. He established tolerable
order and harmony among the rival families of the nobility, and he
struck a blow against the Moors which they never recovered, and which
deserves to be remembered as one of the noblest achievements in the
history of Christendom. After driving their hordes before him across
the Sierra Morena, he gave them battle at a place called Las Navas de
Tolosa, undismayed by their overpowering numbers. During the early part
of the day, it had seemed impossible to resist their countless hordes.
&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Alfonso, turning to the Archbishop of
Toledo, &ldquo;here are we called upon to lay down our life for the
Faith.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered the prelate, with almost
prophetic instinct, &ldquo;say, rather, here are we called to establish
the triumph of the Faith.&rdquo; The cross-bearer, filled with ardour
at the words, rushed into the thickest of the fray; the Christian
soldiery hastened to protect the venerated sign, and so great was the
enthusiasm which Alfonso&rsquo;s bravery kindled, that the infidel host
was entirely routed, and its commander ran away into Africa.</p>
<p>Yet, notwithstanding his bravery and his wisdom, Alfonso, like King
Solomon of old, found it a harder matter to govern himself than to
govern his kingdom; and though he had vanquished his adversaries, he
suffered himself to be led away by his passions. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>At Toledo, now a splendid ruin, then the magnificent capital of his
kingdom, was a beautiful Jewish maiden, named Raguel or Rachel, for
whom he conceived a strong attachment. Now the precepts alike of his
religion and of his high position precluded his union with a Jewess and
an obscure person, yet for all this he refused to part from her. The
voice of the Archbishop, which had so notably animated his drooping
spirits on the field of battle, was powerless with him now; and he
warned him in vain for seven years.</p>
<p>Mindful of the services he had rendered them, and for which they had
awarded him the appellation of &ldquo;the Noble,&rdquo; the people bore
with the scandal all these years in silence, though with averted faces;
but at last, when they found him gradually more and more unmindful of
his former virtues, and all his prowess forgotten that he might
squander his time and his revenues on the fancies of the Jewish maiden,
murmurs began to arise, and they determined to deliver their noble king
from her enchantments.</p>
<p>Hernan Garc&iacute;a de Castro and Alvar Fa&ntilde;ez, two of the
highest nobles of Castille, were foremost in leading the resolve of the
people, and urging it on the king. They had never failed his summons in
the hour of danger, they had fought bravely by his side against their
country&rsquo;s enemies, and their virtue and valour gave weight to
their words. Yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279"
name="pb279">279</a>]</span>the king was so tardy in attending to them
that the people lost all patience.</p>
<p>The king was keeping his court in the sumptuous Alc&aacute;zar, the
palatial fortress whose ruins even yet strike the traveller with
admiration. Abandoning himself to the enjoyments of the delightful
spot, Raguel and he sat one day, surrounded by their favourites and
flatterers. &ldquo;May divine Raguel&rsquo;s surpassing beauty ever
continue to be the aurora of Toledo, ever enamel its brilliant
sunlight!&rdquo; said one of their minstrels, to the accompaniment of
his joyous instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May she rejoice in her surpassing beauty as many ages as
there are sands of gold<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4527src" href=
"#xd21e4527" name="xd21e4527src">1</a> under the limpid torrent of
crystal Tagus!&rdquo; responded another.</p>
<p>Suddenly there burst on their affrighted ears the noise of a
tumultuous gathering of people. The venal minions fled. The king, still
worthy of himself, rose to show himself to his people, and Raguel was
left alone to hear her sentence pronounced in ominous shouts from
without:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p lang="es" class="line">&ldquo;Muera Raguel, para que Alfonso
viva!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Rachel must die, that Alfonso may
live!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Garc&iacute;a de Castro stood between the king and his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>angry people. The king called him a traitor; and
he knelt and laid his sword at his feet, offering willingly to receive
sentence of death if he could be proved a traitor, but insisting on
being heard first. He then exposed to the king the wrongs of which his
people complained. He asked him of what use were all the laurels he had
gathered in the earlier part of his reign, if they were to be hung up
to wither out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corn cannot ripen if the sun withhold its rays, flowers will
not flourish if the gardener neglect to water them, neither can the
Castilian people prosper if their king hide himself from them.&rdquo;
So well did the intrepid Garc&iacute;a plead the right cause, that the
king, overcome by his righteous arguments, promised to be himself
again, to dismiss Raguel, and live once more for his subjects.</p>
<p>Delighted with his promise, the people returned peaceably to their
homes.</p>
<p>The king, however, was not so strong as he thought. He imagined he
had conquered himself, and went to take leave of Raguel. But the
beautiful Jewess had no idea of letting him off so easily. Decked in
her most captivating attire, she came out to meet him, and with her
graces and tears succeeded so well in undermining his determination,
that his promise was forgotten; and, like the ph&oelig;nix from its
ashes, Raguel rose more powerful than ever, and more dangerous too, for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>now a struggle had begun between her and the
people&mdash;one or the other must be vanquished.</p>
<p>Infatuated by her entreaties, the king went so far as to place her
on the throne. The indignation of the Castilians at seeing a low-born
Jewess on the ancient seat of their monarchs, can scarcely be
conceived; but it overflowed all bounds, when decree after decree went
forth, heaping taxes on the Christian population and exemptions on the
Jews&mdash;when proscriptions and executions of the highest in the land
were threatened, and the noble Garc&iacute;a himself was sent into
exile.</p>
<p>In this last step Raguel had outwitted herself. Garc&iacute;a gone,
there was no one to act as moderator of the people. They rose in mass
and stormed the palace; assembling in the basilica, they solemnly
pronounced her worthy of death as an enemy of their king and country,
and with desperate resolve drew their swords and turned to execute
their award on the spot.</p>
<p>The king was absent on a hunting expedition; but Garc&iacute;a, who
had heard of the new rising of the people, risked his life by
infringing the sentence of banishment in order to save the life of his
persecutor.</p>
<p>He succeeded in reaching her before the people had made their way
into her apartment, and telling her of her danger, urged her to fly.
But, loth to lose her high position, she refused, calling on her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>guards to defend her. The Castilian guards,
however, refused to draw on their countrymen in defence of a Jewess.
Meantime the people streamed in, and rushed upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Garc&iacute;a, &ldquo;stain not the bright
steel of your Toledan blades with blood which belongs only to the sword
of the executioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his voice acted for a moment like the spell upon them.</p>
<p>But they were determined not again to leave it in her power to
trample on their ancient institutions, and once more turned to slay
her.</p>
<p>Then <span class="corr" id="xd21e4568" title=
"Source: Alva">Alvar</span> Fa&ntilde;ez drew from his hiding-place
behind the throne, a trembling Jew, who had been Raguel&rsquo;s
minister in her elevation, but had not the courage to defend her now,
and compelled him to be her executioner.</p>
<p>The king, hastily recalled from the chase, arrived but in time to
see her expire. In the first burst of grief and fury he would have
steeped his sword deep in the blood of his subjects; but once more the
good Garc&iacute;a interposed, and by his temperate counsels recalled
him to reason. When the violent throbbing of his agony had subsided, he
acknowledged that his people had acted as a wise surgeon, that he alone
had been in fault, that his punishment was deserved, and once more he
was hailed as</p>

<h2 class="main">DON JAIME DE ARAGON.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The good King of Aragon whom men call Jaime, was
wondrous brave. Day and night he bethought him by what new means he
could increase the glory of the Christian faith, and lay low the power
of the usurping Moor.</p>
<p>He called together the nobles of every degree belonging to his
kingdom, the archbishops and prelates, and all the orders of knights,
and summoned them to meet him in his good town of Zaragoza on a certain
day.</p>
<p>When they had all come together, he spoke thus to
them:&mdash;&ldquo;My soul is greatly grieved that our fair Island of
Mallorca<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4589src" href="#xd21e4589" name=
"xd21e4589src">1</a> should remain in the hand of the Moor; the voice
of our Divine religion is silenced, and Al Kor&aacute;n is openly
taught. The noble seaport of Valencia, too, so rich and flourishing,
which the Cid won back for us once, to our shame is now retaken by the
infidel. Now I have resolved that I will spare nothing, not even my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>own life, to recover these two strongholds. For
I trust in the protection of Christ, that He will give us the victory
according to our prayers. To this end, then, I have called you
together, to tell you this my resolve, and to seek your counsel as to
the means of compassing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which they all responded with a shout of confident
joy:&mdash;&ldquo;Be it done in the Name of God, that which his
Highness desires; for in an undertaking so honourable our goods and our
lives shall not fail him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bearers of all the noble names of Aragon sent forth their sons
that day; and Barcelona by the sea welcomed them, and gave them all
provisions for the undertaking with no measured hand. She found them
ships too to take over their arms and men. And when the king found all
was ready and nothing wanting, he took his place on the ship, and his
nobles followed round him. At break of day next morning the trumpet
gave a blast, and so they set sail, that gallant host, with shouts and
tears of joy, all the brave colours waving which they had borne in many
a fight. The cross they bore aloft, and the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s image,
and that, too, of St. George, who always watched over Aragon.</p>
<p>Proudly they skimmed the water, the oars of the galleys cut the
waves, and the white sails cut the air; for they knew that there gazed
upon them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>from out Monjuy so high, the ladies fair they
had left behind, praying for victory.</p>
<p>Now as they neared Mallorca, the Moors were all amazed; to their
shores they rushed in sudden haste, striving vainly to drive back the
Christian host. So a bloody fight ensued; but the Christians won the
day; and with the help of God the cross was raised once more on all the
islands near.</p>
<p>They then came back by Valencia, laid siege to its strong walls; nor
could its fortifications stand before their impetuous onset. So good
King Jaime of Aragon came home covered with glory and renown.

<h2 class="main">DON ALONSO DE AGUILAR.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The hosts of King Don Ferdinand were gathered under
his banner to go out and recover Granada from the dominion of the
Moors. All the nobles of Spain were there in their strong shining
armour of wrought steel inlaid with gold. It was St. Michael&rsquo;s
day in the morning, and the king called the principal of them into his
tent, and thus said to them:&mdash;&ldquo;Who will be the knight who,
to show his prowess and to cover his name with glory in succeeding
generations, will go up for me to the Snowy Sierra<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4612src" href="#xd21e4612" name=
"xd21e4612src">1</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the nobles looked one on the other, and no one said &ldquo;I
will;&rdquo; for if it was a perilous adventure to go, the return was
utterly uncertain. And for the fear that filled them, you could see
their very beards tremble.</p>
<p>Then arose Don Alonso, who was called &ldquo;of Aguilar,&rdquo; and
said, &ldquo;Good King, I will go. This enterprise is such as I seek. I
have no desire in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287"
name="pb287">287</a>]</span>life but to die defending my country from
the infidel folk; and may Christ give me the mastery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he put on his armour before the king&mdash;his armour all
damascened with gold, and bestrode his noble steed, and slung his broad
shield on his arm, and took in his hand a stout lance with a sharp iron
head. Right valiant he looked in his might as he rode at the head of
his troop.</p>
<p>And they crossed the Snowy Sierra and soon came in sight of the
Moors. And the Moors poured down upon them so closely that they were
well-nigh overwhelmed by numbers. Then the Christian ranks gave way,
and began to fly from the face of the Moor.</p>
<p>Now, when brave Don Alonso saw them give way, he called to them with
a mighty voice and said, &ldquo;Turn! <i lang="es">caballeros</i>,
turn! Turn back to the battle; for though they against us be many, a
coward still is he who shows fear! Remember the mighty deeds of your
old Castilian fathers. Better is it here to die in the noble profession
of arms, than to crawl back to your firesides and live a dishonoured
life. Thus dying you will live, for your fame shall be sung throughout
Spain; for life soon comes to an end, but honour dieth
never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these generous words they felt their hearts come back; each
seemed filled with a giant&rsquo;s strength, and fought till the Moors
stretched him dead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288"
name="pb288">288</a>]</span></p>
<p>Don Alonso remained the last, still brandishing his gory lance, and
ever and anon charging the Moors with an impetuosity none could
resist.</p>
<p>But when the Moors saw their heroes thus mown down, wounded and
dead, with one consent they agreed to attack him on all sides at once.
There he sat erect on his charger; his eye was full of fire, his shield
shone bright on his arm&mdash;dented, indeed, but not pierced, and in
his hand his stout, unbroken lance. But though his horse was so high,
there lay round him such a heap of slain, that when the Moors came to
the attack, as they climbed on the fallen bodies they found themselves
raised to his level.</p>
<p>On they came with frightful <i lang="es">algazara</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4643src" href="#xd21e4643" name=
"xd21e4643src">2</a>; and, stout in each other&rsquo;s presence, they
charged, and thrust, and charged again. The boldest ventured in front,
but before they came within reach of his lance their brethren had
pierced him from behind; and before he could turn to repay them, those
who had been in front thrust him in the side. And they thrust his bonny
horse, too; and the horse and his rider fell there, where they stood,
crowning the mound of the slain. Sixteen lances had pierced Don
Alonso&mdash;pierced him through and through.</p>
<p>But Don Alonso that day had inflicted a loss on the Moors which
filled them with confusion and dismay. Then, from out their ill-guarded
camp, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>came running a Christian captive; it was she who
in days gone by had brought up the young Don Alonso.</p>
<p>Guided by the instinct of a mother, she at once descried his form as
it lay crowning the heap of the victims of his prowess.</p>
<p>So she fell on his neck and wept, and wept till she swooned away,
and wept when she woke again. And she stroked his long, dark hair, and
his cheek that was ashy pale; and his eyes, that could never more see
her, she closed with a mother&rsquo;s care. Then she wrung her fair,
white hands, and she raised her cry to God; and her cry must have
pierced the clouds as it pierced the hearts of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Alonso! my Alonso!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Now, God
receive thy soul; for the cruel Moors have killed thee, the Moors of
Alpujarra! And now all Spain shall mourn thee, mourn thee as a mother
mourns, lamenting thine early death! And King Ferdinand shall mourn
thee, for he has never a knight like thee! Aguilar and Montilla shall
mourn thee, for they&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er have a lord like thee! And
all the host shall mourn thee, for not one has a comrade like thee! But
the angels in heaven mourn <i>not</i>, for my boy is among them with
joy; for he died resisting the pagans who devoured his country
fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she tried, but in vain, to smile, for her mother&rsquo;s heart
was weak; and in the effort it broke, and she fell icy cold at his
feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now an ancient Moor came by, whose beard was long and grey; and she
lay so helpless there, he saw he had nothing to fear, so he drew his
scimitar, and with stealthy steps crept near and severed her dying
head, holding it up by the long dark hair.</p>
<p>By the long dark hair he bore it, to lay at the feet of the king.
Now the Moorish king rejoiced when he knew Don Alonso was dead, Don
Alonso of Aguilar; so he told them to take his body, and that of his
mother as well, and bear to Don Fernando, the king.</p>
<p>And Don Fernando said, &ldquo;Good service this day was done by
Alonso of Aguilar; and though by the Moors he has died, his memory yet
shall live; his deeds shall clothe every knight, in the fancy of every
Moor, with power to equal the prowess of Alonso of Aguilar.&rdquo;

<h2 class="main">THE BLACK CHARGER OF HERNANDO.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hernando was a poor knight, who had spent all in the
service of his country. He had nothing to call his own but his stout
armour, his high-couraged black charger, and his bold lance; and with
these he was ever in the thickest of the fray against the Moors. But at
last his turn came; and in return for the losses he had caused them,
the Moors contrived to surround and slay him.</p>
<p>Now, when his black charger knew that his master was wounded to
death, like a valiant steed true to his Christian master, he turned and
bore him out of the fight to a lonely dell, where a pious hermit might
minister the last consolations of religion to his parting soul. But a
sordid Moor, seeing the helpless dying man thus borne along, determined
to possess himself of his stout armour and his bold black charger; he
followed with fruitless attempts to arrest the gallant beast until it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>pleased him to stop before the hermit&rsquo;s
cell, where it waited patiently while they lifted the sacred burden
down&mdash;the hermit and the Moor together; for the Moor desired to
possess himself of the outer shell of his armour, and the hermit, the
inner shell, namely, his body, that the kernel, that is his soul, might
go up holy and clean before God. Then his soul had scarcely passed
away, when the Moor stripped him of his armour, and packed it all
safely on the back of the black charger, and prepared to lead him home,
for he was afraid himself to mount him. But the black charger no sooner
perceived his dear master&rsquo;s remains safe in the care of the
hermit, to bury them, and his armour safe in his own, than he started
off at his wildest speed, leaving the Moor who had ventured to lay his
infidel hands on the reins, to measure his length in the dust. And on
and on he went, nor stopped till he reached Hernando&rsquo;s hillside
home.</p>
<p>Do&ntilde;a Teresa, his wife, had never ceased every day to look out
for her Hernando&rsquo;s return. And when she saw his black charger,
bearing his empty armour, she knew at once all that had come to pass;
and like a noble Christian spouse, she had the strength to thank God
that her Hernando had spent his life in the service of his religion and
his country. Then she took his precious armour and laid it safely by,
and she caressed the gallant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>black charger, and led him away to
his fresh-littered stall.</p>

Hernando.</span>&mdash;<i>Page 292.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Then every day she tried the armour on the young Hernando, and made
him bestride the black charger, that he might be a valiant slayer of
Moors like his father.</p>
<p>Now young Hernando was slight, and young Hernando was pale. And he
shrank from the cold, hard armour, and the tall, snorting steed. But
his mother Teresa was brave, brave as became a Christian spouse, and
she listened not to his fears; but bade him be of good heart, and put
his trust in Christ.</p>
<p>And at last the day came when she bade him go forth and do battle to
the Moors. Young Hernando&rsquo;s heart beat high, for his spirit
indeed was willing; and he burned to add his name to the long
traditions of prowess which his mother told him of his house. But his
arm was all untried, and he shrank from the thought of pain, for the
young tender flesh was weak. But he would not belie his mother, so he
crossed the bold black charger; and the noble charger snorted, when he
felt that once more he bore a Christian to the battle. By night they
travelled on; and by day they slept in the shade. In the morning, when
the sun began to dawn, they rose, and set out on their way; and as they
crossed a plain, young Hernando saw a tall Moor coming towards them.
And his heart smote <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294"
name="pb294">294</a>]</span>him for fear; and he would gladly have
turned out of the way. But he bethought him it became not a Christian
to shrink away before a Moor; so he nerved him with what courage he
might, and rode on steadily along his way.</p>
<p>Now, when the bold black charger scented the Pagan hound, he
snorted, and shook his mane, and darted to the encounter. So young
Hernando was borne along, and found himself face to face with his foe.
Then his father&rsquo;s shield rose to protect him; and the lance
lifted up his arm; and the black charger rode at the Moor; and the
lance cast him down from his seat. Then the sword leaped from its
scabbard, and planting itself in young Hernando&rsquo;s grasp, struck
off the pagan&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>So Hernando tied the head to his saddle and bound the body upon its
mule. Thus he rode on to the town&mdash;to the town of Royal Burgos.
And when the people saw him bestriding the bold black charger, the
grisly head hanging from his saddle, and the headless body following
behind, bound fast to the African mule, they cried, &ldquo;All hail to
the victor! All hail to young Hernando, who conquered the pagan
Moor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they brought him to the king, and his ghastly burden with
him, and the headless rider behind. And the king rose and embraced him,
and the queen held her fair white hand and gave it the youth to kiss.
And she said, &ldquo;A youth so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295"
href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>comely and valiant should
have armour rich and bright, and a steed with a shining coat.&rdquo; So
she called a page to bring a suit of polished steel, and a horse from
the royal stables, and present them to young Hernando. Then they took
off his ancient armour and laid it on the old black charger, and
Hernando donned the new, and sprang into the saddle of the horse from
the royal stall.</p>
<p>Now the bold black charger was grieved to be thus set aside, so he
snorted and turned his head and rode back to Do&ntilde;a Teresa. When
Do&ntilde;a Teresa saw him ride back with the empty armour, she thought
that her son was dead, and rejoiced as a Christian mother, that the
Moors had sent him to glory. So she laid up the ancient armour, and
caressed the bold black charger, and led him to his fresh-littered
stall.</p>
<p>Young Hernando meantime feared, as he sat on the fiery steed; for in
his far-off hillside home he had but that black charger tried. Nor had
he learnt to handle the weapons they gave him to bear.</p>
<p>But the king, who had seen him come in bearing along such goodly
spoils, took him for a practised warrior, and gave him a work to do
which needed a valiant heart. &ldquo;Now keep this pass,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;for the rocks are narrow and high, and one at a time, as
the enemy comes, with your sword you will strike them down.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>Young Hernando durst not say &lsquo;Nay;&rsquo; for his spirit
within him was bold, though his young tender flesh was weak. And as he
watched there alone, with only the moon for guide, &ldquo;Oh, had I my
old black charger, and my father&rsquo;s armour!&rdquo; he cried. And
the bold black charger felt, as he stood in his far-off stall, that his
master&rsquo;s son was in danger, and he snorted to get away. And
Do&ntilde;a Teresa knew when she heard him snort and snort there was
work to do far away. So she bound the armour on him, and away he fled
like the wind, nor stopped till he reached Hernando.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me! my bold black charger! To me! &rsquo;tis yet in time!
To me!&rdquo; And he mounted the charger bold, in his father&rsquo;s
armour clad.</p>
<p>Then stealthily came the Moors, all creeping through the pass, and
Hernando&rsquo;s lance and Hernando&rsquo;s sword laid them low on the
ground that night. And when the king came up, Hernando sat at his post,
and his prostrate foes around him.</p>
<p>When the king saw he had done so bravely, he would have given him a
new suit of armour, and a new bright-coated steed. But Hernando said,
&ldquo;Good king! pray leave me my father&rsquo;s armour and my
father&rsquo;s charger bold, for I am but a stripling, and my hand and
my arm are weak, but my father&rsquo;s arms and my father&rsquo;s steed
alone put the foe to flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the king let him have his will; and as he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>found him so brave and successful against the
Moors, he sent him to carry a message of encouragement to Don Diaz, to
whom the Moors had laid siege. Now, as he came back from the errand, he
was crossing the lonely plain, when anon it was covered with
horsemen&mdash;Moorish horsemen, arrayed in their might. He knew that
his trust was sacred, and he might not endanger the letter he bore by
encountering so overpowering a host. But &lsquo;twas vain that he tried
to turn, for the bold black charger refused; but, as if he had been
spurred, with his might he dashed right into the Pagan midst. The lance
sprang in Hernando&rsquo;s hand and pierced through the Moorish king.
Then the host, dismayed, exclaimed, &ldquo;This one rider alone in his
strength, no mortal man is he: it is one of their Christian saints come
down to scatter the Prophet&rsquo;s band.&rdquo; So they turned and
fled apace, and on the black charger rode behind; and Hernando&rsquo;s
lance and Hernando&rsquo;s sword laid low the straggling host.</p>
<p>And such fear had fallen on all the Prophet&rsquo;s children that
day, that on bended knee they sent to sue a truce of the Christian
king. And to purchase a term of rest, they set all their captives free,
and with tribute and with hostages made peace with the Christian
king.</p>
<p>So young Hernando rode home&mdash;to his home by the steep hillside.
And Do&ntilde;a Teresa came out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>to greet her boy on his
gallant steed. And with her, fair Melisenda walked, who a gentler
greeting gave; she was his bride betrothed, and she knew that now peace
was made, they would lovingly live together, in that far-off hillside
home.</p>
<p>And they stroked the bold black charger, and led him to his
fresh-littered stall. And &lsquo;tis said that while yet the land was
blighted by <i>one</i> strange<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4739src"
href="#xd21e4739" name="xd21e4739src">1</a> Moor, that bold black
charger never died; but whenever the fight raged high, or the Christian
host needed aid, there he bore his rider to turn the day. But where he
died or when he fell, no mortal ever knew. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE INFANTE DON HENRIQUE AND THE LIONS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Infante Don Henrique had a dispute with his
brother, King Alfonso. And, as he wished not to fight with him, thought
it most prudent to go over to Barbary. As the King of Tunis had been in
great awe of his father, and was very desirous not to run any risk of a
collision with the Christians, he took pains to treat Don Henrique
well, and entertained him honourably for more than four years, and
instructed all his people to behave to him kindly.</p>
<p>Mean time, Don Henrique&rsquo;s princely bearing won all hearts. In
all games, and feats of strength and horsemanship, and trials of arms,
he bore away the palm; so that all men admired him and cried,
&ldquo;God save him!&rdquo; till at last the advisers of the King of
Tunis feared that they would want next to make him their king, and they
would all be under power of the Christians, and the name of the Prophet
be put out. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>Don Henrique was so valiant, however, and so were all the
Christians, his companions, that they dared not attack him openly. And
the king saw the danger full well, but durst not interfere either to
attack or defend him, for he was divided between love for the young
prince and alarm for his own safety.</p>
<p>At last, an astute old Moor devised a plan which should rid them of
the young prince without putting them in any danger of suffering from
his resistance or the vengeance of his followers, for it should not
appear that they of the Moorish sect had any thing to do with it, but
it should seem a natural calamity.</p>
<p>The old Moor poured it into the king&rsquo;s ear<span class="corr"
id="xd21e4757" title="Not in source">,</span> and the king could not
but say it was well found; and, for all his love for the young prince,
he could not resist taking so easy a way for ridding himself of a great
danger.</p>
<p>The young prince, in his ingenuousness, suspected nothing. He was
used to go out hunting with the king; and now that he invited him to a
hunting party, he was only glad to join the gallant sport.</p>
<p>The Moorish king led him on, away from the rest of the party, into a
wild part of the thicket, which, according to the plan of the old Moor,
had been turned into a <i>corral</i>, or enclosed ground having no
outlet, but so overgrown with bushes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>that the prince could
not perceive the trap. Then the old Moor, who was on the watch, as soon
as they entered the fatal precincts, gave a signal to his men, who let
loose and turned in two fierce hungry lions. The prince, not at all
dismayed, drew his sword, and rode right up to them. The lions cowered
before his prowess, and did not attempt to attack him, so he drove them
before him across the <i>corral</i>, and then he saw it was closed in
and had no opening but into the den where the lions had been kept; he
shut them in and made it fast, and knew now it was a snare; but the
king, not daring to face him, had turned and ridden away.</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s heart was grieved, for he had thought the king
was his friend, but he said, &ldquo;I will not remain where my presence
is considered a burden.&rdquo; The Spanish companions with him wanted
him to wreak signal vengeance on the treacherous pagans, but Don
Henrique said, &ldquo;As I am a Christian, I shed no man&rsquo;s blood
in personal vengeance; but neither will I leave this ungrateful land
without one stroke for Christ. Now these pagans hold in bondage a
multitude of Christian captives; go, tell their king that if he fears
our presence, we will go, but we leave not our brethren
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king found that his plan had failed, he was filled with
anger at the old man who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=
"#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>had invented it, that he sent and
cut off his head, and then he sat trembling with fear at the vengeance
Don Henrique might take. So, when they brought him his message, he
received it with gladness, and ordered that all who had Christian
slaves in their house should give them up to Don Henrique. And, as Don
Henrique&rsquo;s galleys were not enough to contain all the multitude
of captives he had saved, the king ordered others to be lent him, so
that only the danger might be removed from his coast.</p>
<p>Then the Christian fleet set sail, and God sent them a prosperous
wind; and so they came to Rome, where Don Henrique joined the banner of
Charles of Anjou, and did deeds of valour in his cause. <span class=

<h2 class="main">BLANCA THE HAUGHTY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Count of Tolosa had a beautiful daughter called
Blanca, and he had promised her in marriage to the son of the Count of
Barcelona. Both were young, and rich, and noble; and all the people
from both provinces gathered together to celebrate the wedding with
every testimony of interest in their happiness. But Blanca was very
self-willed; she had always had every thing her own way&mdash;a noble
palace in the midst of an enchanting country, plenty of servitors to do
her bidding, many knights to contend for her favour; and she seemed to
fancy that the whole earth and all who lived in it were made for her,
and that all must conform themselves to her desires. Nothing was ever
good enough to please her.</p>
<p>Her father had thought she would grow out of these foolish ways as
she became older and wiser, and had never duly corrected her; and she,
meanwhile, became more practised in them, and chose the occasion of her
marriage-f&ecirc;te for the wildest of all her pranks. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>While all were seated in the great hall of the castle at the high
banquet, and all lips were overflowing with praises, perhaps also with
envy at her happiness, the young count, offering her a basket of rich
fruits, proposed to divide with her a fine pomegranate. Blanca
condescended to give him permission to do so, but the count with all
his dexterity could not avoid letting one of the luscious ruby pips
fall upon the table; then, as if afraid of leaving a spot before her
eyes as a testimony of his awkwardness, he hastily took up the pip, and
put it to his mouth.</p>
<p>Blanca, who had all the morning been on the look out in vain for
some captious pretext on which to found a quarrel, and show off her
haughty, petulant airs, immediately caught at this one, and exclaimed,
she would never be bound to such a parsimonious husband; it was an act
unworthy of a noble; a man who was afraid of losing the value of a
pomegranate pip must be a sorry mate indeed; he would not do for
<i>her</i>!</p>
<p>It was vain, the young count tried to pacify her by explaining how
utterly false was the view she had taken. Equally vain, that her father
reasoned with her on the childishness of her conduct, or that her
companions pleaded in favour of the disconcerted bridegroom. Blanca
would not listen to reason, and the poor young count found himself at
last left alone, an object of derision, or at least of pity, to the
whole assembly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305"
name="pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>He really loved Blanca, and had before this day put up with many
caprices out of his affection for her; but this was not only a tax on
his patience and good temper, it was an affront on his name and lineage
which must not be borne. And yet he loved Blanca too much to resort to
any act of hostility which might put a further barrier between them.
Uncertain how to act, he went out and rode away, spurring his horse,
not caring whither he went, so that he could go far away from the face
of his fellow-men and muse over his grief. But all the time there ran
ringing in his head,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;No more a noble count, I trow,</p>
<p class="line">A humble shepherd seem I now!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">though he could not think what the lines meant, yet he
went on till he had got far away into a distant forest, where all was
savage and wild, and where there was nothing to remind him of the
scenes he had passed through. There he alighted from his good steed,
and threw himself on the hard ground. The sword which he had been wont
to raise so bravely against the enemies of his country clanked
listlessly by his side, the sharp rocks cut his cheeks, and his noble
blood flowed from the rents, while he felt them not, for his heart bled
with other and deeper wounds; but all the time there ran in his head
the lines,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;No more a noble count, I trow,</p>
<p class="line">A humble shepherd seem I now!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>After he had lain there some time, and the passion of his sorrow had
so far cooled down that he began to take notice of the objects around
him, he observed two milk-white doves perched lovingly side by side on
the branches over his head, yet fluttering full of fear and trouble.
Full of his own recent suffering, he felt singular compassion for the
two frightened birds; and searching for the cause of their distress, he
perceived a great hawk hovering in the air above, in ever-nearing
circles, and with glaring eyes preparing to pounce on his luckless
prey. The count at once understood their danger, and picking up a
stone, threw it with such force and dexterous aim, that it brought down
the greedy hawk dead upon the ground. The doves no sooner found
themselves delivered from their pursuer, than they gave every token of
gladness and delight, hopping from branch to branch, fluttering away
and pursuing each other, and then again loving each other in the
gentlest way.</p>
<p>The count could not bear to see their happiness, it reminded him of
his loss; so he got up and wandered on into a dark cave where he could
see nothing, and there laid him down; and the lines running in his head
lulled him to sleep,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;No more a noble count, I trow,</p>
<p class="line">A humble shepherd seem I now!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then in his dream he saw one of the fair doves
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>appear to him in the form of a beautiful woman;
her face was of the softest pink and white, like the face of the sky at
sunrise, and her eyes were so bright and lustrous that they illumined
the whole cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Caballero, caballero!</i>&rdquo; said the bright
vision; &ldquo;you do not recognize me, I fear; nevertheless, I am
indeed one of those poor doves whose lives you saved from the wicked
hawk but now; and if I and my mate live in love of each other, it is to
you we owe the boon. I am come to pay the debt I owe you, and I know
there is only one way in which I can do it, and that is by telling you
how to get for <i>your</i> mate Blanca, for whose sake you are now so
sad. I promise you that in a very little time you shall have it all
your own way with her, and she shall become as humble as she now is
haughty. Meanwhile, take this ring, which I have enchanted on purpose
for you, and whatever you ask of it, you will find that it will do it
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the beautiful vision disappeared, and the cave immediately
became dark and gloomy as before.</p>
<p>The moment the count woke, the memory of his vision rose up before
him, and he lost no time in feeling whether he had the ring safe. There
it was all right on his finger; and when he felt it, he put his
confidence in the promise of the vision, and hastened to go back out of
the cave and set to work. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href=
"#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>He had no sooner found his way
again into daylight, than he took off his ring, and thus addressed
it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Aniellico, aniellico<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4846src" href="#xd21e4846" name="xd21e4846src">1</a>!</i> now is
the time come to show your devotion to me. You know how Blanca has
scorned me, and how I fear to go near her again, lest she should put
some fresh affront in her wilfulness upon me, and yet I cannot bear to
stay away from her. Tell me, ring, what I shall do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attend, attend,&rdquo; answered the ring; &ldquo;watch now
what you see passing before your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the ring spoke, the count saw a moor-hen scudding away across the
plain, and a cock as fast as he could following after her. The hen
seemed determined to have nothing to say to the cock; but the cock was
so persevering that he came up to her, and made her stand still and
listen to him, and then he first knocked her about a good deal, and
then soothed her down, and at last they both went off together quite
amicably; and the ring sang,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock o&rsquo;ercomes, though somewhat
rough,</p>
<p class="line">So man, no less, the coy rebuff</p>
<p class="line xd21e3723">Of woman!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;what you
mean; but I do <i>not</i> at all see how you mean me to carry out your
plan.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said the ring; &ldquo;only do as I
advise you, and according to the instructions of my lady the dove, I
will give you all you wish. And now, in the first instance, you must
take off all this fine armour, and all your noble dress, and put on
this disguise of a shepherd; and then take this loom, as if you were
going, like the poor shepherd, to weave the wool of your flock; and now
come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as they went along together, the ring told him all that he was
to do, and what to say, and it had hardly completed its instructions
when they arrived at the gate of the gardens of the Count of Tolosa,
every now and then interrupting its discourse to sing,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock o&rsquo;ercomes, though somewhat
rough,</p>
<p class="line">So man, no less, the coy rebuff</p>
<p class="line xd21e3723">Of woman!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A gruff old gardener came out to see who called; and
when he saw it was only a country bumpkin of a shepherd, he was gruffer
than ever, and bid him begone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gardener, gardener!&rdquo; said the disguised count in his
most insinuating accents, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think, now, if you
were to let me come in and help you, you would get through your work
much more easily? You have a hard time of it, and get little rest. I am
young and strong, and should soon accomplish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>what
you have to do, and then you need not turn out so early in the morning,
nor sit up so late at night watching this gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Pastorcillo, pastorcillo<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4889src" href="#xd21e4889" name="xd21e4889src">2</a>!</i>&rdquo;
rejoined the old gardener, quite tamed by this appeal, &ldquo;I cannot
say Nay to such an offer; so come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The count lost no time in obeying; and at once began fulfilling his
promise, by taking the sheep out of the fold and leading them out to
pasture. In doing this, he took care to direct them straight towards
the windows of the palace. Arrived there, he sat down and placed his
loom, and began weaving away diligently after the manner of poor
shepherds, and singing the while,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock o&rsquo;ercomes, though somewhat
rough,</p>
<p class="line">So man, no less, the coy rebuff</p>
<p class="line xd21e3723">Of woman!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He had not been sitting there long, before he observed
a postern in the wall which separated the castle-keep from the private
gardens, open. How his heart beat! Might it not be Blanca coming out
for a walk? No, it was only one of her attendants, who had come to see
what the shepherd was weaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, <i lang="es">Don Villano</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4908src" href="#xd21e4908" name="xd21e4908src">3</a>,&rdquo; she
cried, as she came near him, &ldquo;what wondrous kind of stuff, is
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>you are weaving? Is it a heavenly or an earthly
texture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a stuff much too fine for such as <i>you</i>. It is
such a stuff as has not its like in all the world, and cannot be
bartered for cloth of gold; for whoever wears this stuff, however old
they may be, immediately appears young, and if already young, it makes
them beautiful too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he went on weaving, without paying any attention to her,
any more than if he had not seen her, nor seeming to hear any of her
questions or entreaties, and singing the while,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock o&rsquo;ercomes, though somewhat
rough,</p>
<p class="line">So man, no less, the coy rebuff</p>
<p class="line xd21e3723">Of woman!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When the <i lang="es">due&ntilde;a</i> found she could
make no impression on him she ran off at last to call Blanca, who was
not yet out of bed, crying long before she got within hearing,
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Infantina, Infantina<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4935src" href="#xd21e4935" name="xd21e4935src">4</a>!</i> get up
and come down quickly, for here in your gardens is a shepherd who is
weaving a stuff which cannot be matched in all the world, and cannot be
bartered for cloth of gold; for whoever puts on a garment made of it
will instantly appear young, how old soever they may have been before;
and if they are already young and beautiful, it will make them much
more so.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312"
name="pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now the waiting-maid, it must be observed, was neither young nor
pretty, and she was most desirous to get possession of the stuff; and
as the shepherd would not give it to her, she was dying to make her
young mistress get it from him.</p>
<p>Blanca&rsquo;s curiosity was sufficiently whetted by the
description, to get up in all haste and come down, and see the strange
shepherd herself.</p>
<p>The count&rsquo;s heart beat indeed, as she came near; and she
looked so handsome, and so haughty, that the sight brought back the
memory of all her cruelty, so that he was divided between the
inclination to throw himself at her feet and beg her to come and be
reasonable, and the resolve to follow the advice of the ring, and give
her a lesson that should make her a good wife. But the ring adjured him
to keep quite quiet, and not even look up at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be with you, this morning, <i lang=
"es">villano</i>!&rdquo; she exclaimed, rather loud, with a little
sharp cough, to attract his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May He have you in His good keeping, <i lang=
"es">ni&ntilde;a</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4955src" href=
"#xd21e4955" name="xd21e4955src">5</a>!&rdquo; rejoined the disguised
shepherd, without looking up from his loom.</p>
<p>Blanca was not accustomed to be treated in this way; and she felt
very much inclined to call some of the servants to chastise the
supposed shepherd for his rudeness. Nevertheless, there was something
about his manner that both awed as well as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>interested her to an unaccountable degree, and
far too much to let her give up diving farther into the mystery that
surrounded him without another attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Villano, villano!</i>&rdquo; she said, at last,
&ldquo;tell me, I pray, the tissue you are weaving, who taught you to
weave it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven fairies, lady,&rdquo; replied the feigned shepherd,
&ldquo;who live in seven towers, and who never sleep or dine; but are
constantly weaving and singing this refrain, which I sing continually
too, lest I should forget it:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock o&rsquo;ercomes, though somewhat
rough,</p>
<p class="line">So man, no less, the coy rebuff</p>
<p class="line xd21e3723">Of woman!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And with that he went on working away as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you want to sell it, don&rsquo;t you, <i lang=
"es">villano</i>,&rdquo; continued Blanca, trying not to look vexed.
&ldquo;Now if you like, I&rsquo;ll buy it of you, and you may ask what
you like; money, or jewels, or whatever you will, and I will pay the
price.&rdquo; And when she had said that, she thought such a bait would
be sufficient to make him obsequious.</p>
<p>But far from this, he drew himself up proudly, and told her that all
her money and jewels were useless to him; that whoever makes up his
mind to contemn riches is richer than all the world; and he who is
content with the food and raiment earned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>by his daily toil
cannot be bribed by gold. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, speaking a
little lower and more softly, &ldquo;there is one condition on which I
part with my fine weft, and only one. The woman I give it to must be
<i>my wife</i>!&rdquo; and then he resumed his indifferent manner
again, and went on weaving, and singing the while,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock o&rsquo;ercomes, though somewhat
rough,</p>
<p class="line">So man, no less, the coy rebuff</p>
<p class="line xd21e3723">Of woman!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Blanca seemed riveted to the spot. She had long
mourned&mdash;quite in secret and in silence, the loss of her fond
admirer, the Count of Barcelona, and often her heart was&mdash;quite in
secret and in silence&mdash;cut to the quick with the thought,
&ldquo;Suppose he should never come back to me!&rdquo; Though she
appeared outwardly gay and haughty as before, this care was continually
preying on her mind; she treasured up, quite in secret and in silence,
every little thing that could remind her of him; and whenever a
stranger came to her father&rsquo;s castle, though she pretended
scarcely to look at him, she scrutinized him through and through, to
see if he could be bearer of any tidings from the absent count. Now
there was something about the shepherd that re-awakened all her
sorrows, and all her hopes. She did not know what it was. She was too
agitated to suspect that it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315"
href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>he himself, and yet she felt
so drawn towards him, she could not tear herself away. The audacity of
such words was great, however, coming from one in his humble garb; and
she felt she must administer some strong reproof; so, assuming a show
of all the indignation she could call to her aid, she half turned away,
exclaiming, &ldquo;Begone, <i lang="es">villano</i>! nor dare to
approach me. If you come but one step nearer, I will call my
father&rsquo;s men to kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Soperbica, soperbica<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5009src" href="#xd21e5009" name="xd21e5009src">6</a>!</i>&rdquo;
replied the shepherd, with most provoking coolness. &ldquo;You are very
proud now; but I swear to you that you will not always take that tone.
You will talk to me very differently some day. For so the seven fairies
promised me when they taught me the song,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cock o&rsquo;ercomes, though somewhat
rough,</p>
<p class="line">So man, no less, the coy rebuff</p>
<p class="line xd21e3723">Of woman!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The <i lang="es">due&ntilde;a</i>, who had been
standing by, watching this scene with the greatest anxiety, intent only
on getting a chance of possessing some of the weft which was to make
her young and beautiful, was driven beyond endurance by the turn
matters were now taking. So she called her young mistress aside and
descanted so earnestly on the incomparable powers of the cloth and the
little probability <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>of ever meeting with such a chance again if
she neglected this one, and threw in, too, such clever hints about easy
ways of getting over the difficulty,&mdash;that the simple shepherd
could easily be deceived, that she could pretend she was going to
listen to his attentions, though it need only be pretence, and in the
meantime she would get his priceless treasure out of him,&mdash;that
poor little Blanca was quite bewildered. She was, indeed, so anxious to
see more of the mysterious shepherd, and so possessed with the vague
fancy that there was some connexion between him and the Count of
Barcelona, that it was no very difficult matter to overcome her
scruples, particularly as the <i lang="es">due&ntilde;a</i> promised to
smooth the way a little for her.</p>
<p>The count, who had also been a little frightened, lest he had spoken
too abruptly, was also willing to receive the
<i>due&ntilde;a&rsquo;s</i> mediation, and in a very little time Blanca
had obtained possession of the texture; but the count had also played
his game so successfully, that Blanca was quite under his influence,
and could think and dream of nothing else, nor rest till she had an
opportunity of meeting him again. Of course this was not difficult, and
the <i lang="es">due&ntilde;a</i> was ready enough to assist her, as
she thought the shepherd might have some other precious gift to
impart.</p>
<p>Nor was she mistaken. The count consulted his ring as to what he
should do next, and the ring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=
"#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>gave him a fowl which laid pearls
for eggs, and the chickens that came out of them had feathers like
gold.</p>
<p>When Blanca saw this, she could not forbear coming down into the
garden to ask for the beautiful fowl. The shepherd was feeding her with
gold corn, and he went on throwing down the grains without taking any
notice of her approach, but singing,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My fair begins to yield;</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m safe to win the field!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Pastorcillo, pastorcillo!</i> give
me the beautiful fowl!&rdquo; said Blanca <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5055" title="Source: imporingly">imploringly</span>. &ldquo;I
should <i>so</i> like to have her. I shall cry if you won&rsquo;t give
her <i lang="es">pastorcillo</i>;&rdquo; she continued, as the count
turned on his heels, and continued singing,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My fair begins to yield;</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m safe to win the field!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i lang="es">Pastorcillo!</i> listen,&rdquo;
repeated the poor child sadly, for though she did not recognize the
count, he had so enthralled her, that she felt towards the supposed
shepherd as she had never felt towards any but him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cease that horrid song, and speak to me,&rdquo; she said
at last, and so humbly, that the count thought it was time to put in a
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come away with me? because otherwise <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>it
is no use talking,&rdquo; he said, somewhat abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; retorted Blanca, indignantly; &ldquo;and you
had better take care, and not talk so loud, for if my father overheard
you, he would send and have you strung up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the shepherd did not care a bit, he had in the meantime spoken
to her father, and told him what his plan was; and received from him
the hearty approval of his scheme for bringing his incorrigible
daughter to reason; so he sang out louder than before,&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My fair begins to yield;</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;m safe to win the field!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Blanca had never been treated in this way, and did not
know what to make of it. She turned to go away, but then the dread
stole over her, suppose the shepherd should go away as mysteriously as
he had come, and then there would be no one left to remind her of the
count. She could not bear to think of it: she turned, and said
faintly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Pastorcillo!</i> give me the beautiful fowl; you
must give it me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going away, Blanca,&rdquo; he replied, but less sternly
than before. It was the first time he had called her by her name, and
it seemed as if she heard the count speaking. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Going away!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in blank despair;
&ldquo;oh, you must take me with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take you with me!&rdquo; repeated the shepherd. &ldquo;No,
you said you wouldn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I did not know what I was saying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now,&rdquo; replied the count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I shall come, whether you will or no,&rdquo; she said
pertly; for every time he spoke his words seemed to rivet more firmly
the chain which bound her to her affianced husband, it seemed as if he
was his spectre come to avenge him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it, if you choose to do <i>that</i>,&rdquo; was
all his answer, and he turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me, <i lang="es">Pastorcillo</i>!&rdquo; she said once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not like to come where I have to go,&rdquo;
answered the supposed shepherd. &ldquo;My dwelling is a dark cave,
where no light ever enters. My bed is the sharp rock, which cuts
through to the bones. My drink is water, muddy and cold; and my meat is
grief and mourning. No companions are there where I live, for all men
and women hold my way of living in dread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Blanca heard this, she turned pale; nevertheless, she could not
see him go without her, and still asked to go.</p>
<p>The shepherd walked on without saying a word. Blanca followed him as
if drawn by magic.</p>
<p>Away they went, sad and silent: far, far away; over rocks and
declivities, through streams and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320"
href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>torrents, past briars and
brakes. For months they went on thus; the count going on
before,&mdash;Blanca, sad and silent, after him. They never entered any
town; and their only food was the berries they found in the wood, and
the water of the brooks they crossed. Blanca&rsquo;s fair soft skin was
burnt brown by the sun and parched up by the wind; her hands were torn
by the thorns, and her feet bleeding from the unevennesses of the way.
At last a day came when she could go no farther. She sank down fainting
on the earth, but she was so humble now, she did not so much as proffer
a word of complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Blanca?&rdquo; inquired the count.
&ldquo;Do you give up following me any farther?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Pastorcillo!</i> mock me not. You see I would
follow you gladly, but you see too my strength is at an end; I can go
no farther;&rdquo; and with that her senses failed.</p>
<p>When the count saw her in this condition, he took pity on her, and,
lifting her up in his arms, carried her to a shepherd&rsquo;s hut at no
great distance along the moor, and there the good wife attended to her,
putting her in her poor bed, and gently trying to bring her to again.
But it was all of no use, she continued in the swoon, and the poor
peasant&rsquo;s restoratives were of no avail.</p>
<p>When the count saw this, he was in despair, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>and
sitting down under shadow of a rock, he took out his ring to ask it
what was to be done, now being almost ready to reproach it for having
led him to be so cruel.</p>
<p>But the ring told him to be of good heart, and all the promises of
the milk-white dove would be fulfilled. &ldquo;Blanca has now learnt a
lesson, and acquired a habit of submission which she will not forget
all through her life. And besides, after she has given such strong
proofs of love and devotion towards you, she will have no inclination
to resume the provoking ways with which she tormented you before, so
you may safely discover yourself to her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the good ring suddenly pronounced some words near the
peasant&rsquo;s hut, and it became a fine palace, and the bed on which
Blanca was lying became covered with beautiful embroidered coverlets,
and all around were clothes fit for a countess to wear. The Count, too,
was provided with a shining suit of armour and a prancing charger, and
by its side a palfrey for his bride, and a train of noble knights and
dames to attend them. Over Blanca, too, the ring said some words, and
her consciousness came back to her, and when she saw the Count standing
by her side, looking just as he did the day he dropped the pomegranate
pip, it seemed as if she had never seen him in any other garb, only
that he kept singing a verse the ring had taught him&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;She spurned me, bridegroom, in her pride!</p>
<p class="line">Then with a shepherd would abide;</p>
<p class="line">Yet loved me still, for I have tried</p>
<p class="line">Her love, as gold is purified!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">till she begged him not to sing it, but so gently and
submissively, that he could not resist. So he lifted her on to her
palfrey, and the whole noble train moved on towards his father&rsquo;s
palace, where she lived by his side all her life, a model of a devoted
wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=

<h2 class="label">I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">ISSY-BEN-ARAN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though the Moors were always hated in Spain, first as
a conquering and afterwards as a conquered race, yet many poetical
traces of their traditions and maxims remain in the popular literature
of the country; and in some of these they appear in a very advantageous
light, though, of course, the national hatred loved rather to record
those of a contrary import.</p>
<p>Issy-ben-Aran was a venerable muleteer, well-known in all the towns
of Granada for his worth and integrity&mdash;an elder and a father
among his tribe.</p>
<p>One day, as he was journeying over a wild and sequestered track of
the Sierra Nevada, he heard a cry of pain proceeding from the
road-side. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>good old man immediately turned back to render
help to the unfortunate. He found a young man lying among the sharp
points of an aloe hedge, groaning as if at the last gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails thee? Son, speak,&rdquo; said Issy-ben-Aran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was journeying along the road, father, an hour agone, as
full of health as you may be, when I was set upon by six robbers, who
knocked me off my mule, and not satisfied with carrying off all I
possessed in the world, beat me till they thought I was dead, and then
flung my body into this aloe hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Issy-ben-Aran gave him a draught of water from his own <i lang=
"es">bota</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e5184src" href="#xd21e5184"
name="xd21e5184src">1</a> and bound his head with linen cloths steeped
in fresh water, then he set him on his own beast to carry him at a
gentle pace to the nearest town and further care for him, with great
strain of his feeble arms lifting him tenderly into the saddle.</p>
<p>No sooner was the stranger well mounted, with his feet firmly set in
the stirrups, than, drawing himself up with no further appearance of
weakness, he dug his heels into the horse&rsquo;s side, and setting up
a loud laugh, started off at a rapid gallop.</p>
<p>Issy-ben-Aran, to whom every stone of the road was known as the
lines upon his right hand, immediately scrambled down the
mountain-side, so as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325"
name="pb325">325</a>]</span>to confront the stranger at the turning of
the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he cried. And the nag, who loved his master
well, stood still and refused to move for all the stranger&rsquo;s
urging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son! think not I am come to reproach you,&rdquo; said the old
man. &ldquo;If you desire the horse, even take it at a gift; you shall
not burden your conscience with a theft on my account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; scoffed the heartless stranger. &ldquo;It
is fine to make a merit of necessity; but I have nothing to do but ride
to the nearest town, and sell the brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware! and do it not,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;The
nag of Issy-ben-Aran is known at every market in the kingdom, and any
man of all our tribes who frequents them, finding you with him, will
reckon you have killed me, and slay you in turn. Even for this have I
come to you: take this scroll to show that you have it of me as a free
gift, and so no harm shall come to you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one condition I exact. Bind yourself to me, that you
tell no man of what has passed between us; lest peradventure, should it
become known, a man hearing his brother cry out in distress might say,
&lsquo;This man is feigning, that he may take my horse like the horse
of Issy-ben-Aran,&rsquo; and the man who is really in danger be thus
left to perish miserably.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326"

<h2 class="main">M&Oacute;STAFA ALVIL&Aacute;.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">M&oacute;stafa Alvil&aacute; was califf of a conquered
province in Spain, where he reigned with oriental state. The tributary
people were ground down with hard work to minister to his treasury, and
the vast sums he amassed were spent in beautifying his Alc&aacute;zar,
and filling it with costly productions from all parts. Merchants from
every climate under heaven were encouraged to come and offer him their
choicest wares.</p>
<p>One day, a merchant of Persia brought a large pack of shawls and
carpets, all woven in gold and pearls, and wools and silks of brilliant
colours, but among them all the most beautiful was one carpet of great
price, on which M&oacute;stafa Alvil&aacute;&rsquo;s choice was
immediately set; but in all his treasury there was not found the price
of it. Nothing would do, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href=
"#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span><i>must</i> possess it: then Ali
Bab&aacute; his vizier came forward and said, &ldquo;Let ten thousand
dogs of Christians be sold, and with the price of them you shall
purchase the carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&oacute;stafa Alvil&aacute; answered and said, &ldquo;The advice is
good!&rdquo; So they sent and sold ten thousand Christians, and with
the price of them the carpet was bought.</p>
<p>M&oacute;stafa Alvil&aacute; sat contemplating the curious devices,
and tracing the wonderful arabesque patterns with which the carpet was
covered; and there was one pattern, all shining with gold and pearls,
quite prominent in the centre, which had a likeness to the characters
of an inscription; and when M&oacute;stafa Alvil&aacute; saw it, he was
very curious to know if it was an inscription, and what it meant, so he
sent to recall the merchant; but he was gone from the Alc&aacute;zar.
Then he sent his servants after him, and though they travelled three
days&rsquo; journey by every road, they could neither find him nor
obtain any tidings of whither he had passed. Then M&oacute;stafa
Alvil&aacute; was more curious, and sent and gathered all the learned
men in his califate, and inquired of them what the inscription might
mean. They all looked troubled, and said they could not tell, they had
never seen such letters. But one there was who concealed the difficulty
he was in so ill, that M&oacute;stafa Alvil&aacute; saw he knew what
the writing meant, so he looked very severely upon him and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>threatened him with instant death if he did not
tell him exactly what the writing was.</p>
<p>Then the interpreter, when he found there was no other way to save
his life, with great fear and trembling said, this is the meaning
thereof:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Shiroes, son of Chosroes,
killed his father; and he died six months after.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>M&oacute;stafa Alvil&aacute; was greatly troubled when he heard the
sentence; for <i>he</i> had ascended the califate by killing his
father, and he had reigned six months all but one day. So he sent and
commanded that the interpreter and all who had heard the sentence
should be put to death, that no one might know the omen.</p>
<p>But that night, in the middle of the dark hours, when M&oacute;stafa
Alvil&aacute; was alone in his chamber, a horrible vision came to him.
He thought he saw the body of his father whom he had murdered rise up
to convict him. He sunk down in his bed, and covered his face in fear
and horror.</p>
<p>In the morning, when they came to call him, they found only his
lifeless corpse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Emir Abu-Bekir lost an eye in battle against the
Christians. &ldquo;The Christians shall pay me what they have taken
from me,&rdquo; he said; and he sent for a number of Christian
captives, and had one of their eyes taken out, in the idea of replacing
his own; but it was found that none of them agreed with his in size,
and form, and colour. The Emir Abu-Bekir was of very comely person, and
his eyes had been so mild and soft, that it was at last thought only
the eye of a woman could replace the missing one; the choice fell upon
a beautiful maiden named Sancha. Sancha was brought into the
Emir&rsquo;s presence, and his physician was ordered to take out her
eye, and place it in the vacant socket.</p>
<p>Now Sancha stood trembling and wailing, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>by
her very crying damaging the perfection of the coveted feature. Then
there stood up a travelling doctor who was in great fame among the
people, and begged a hearing of the Emir; for albeit he was a Turk, yet
he possessed pity and gratitude. He knew that the operation, while a
torment to the Christian maiden, would be of no service to the Emir;
and he pitied the waste of pain. It happened further, that once, when
on a journey he had sunk fainting by the way-side, this very Sancha had
comforted and relieved him; and now he determined to rescue her.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he stepped up to the Emir, and told him that he had
eyes made of crystal, and coloured by cunning art, which no one could
tell from living eyes, and which would be of much greater service and
ornament than those of the Christian dogs, whose eyes he might have
observed lost all their lustre and consistency the moment they were
taken from their natural place. The Emir admitted the truth of the last
statement, and being marvellously pleased with the glass eyes the
travelling doctor displayed, asked him the price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maiden for a slave,&rdquo; replied the doctor.</p>
<p>The Emir gladly consented to so advantageous a bargain, and suffered
the glass eye to be fixed in his head. All the Court applauded the
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot see with it!&rdquo; cried the Emir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you must give it a little time to get used <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>to
your ways,&rdquo; answered the doctor, readily; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
expect it all of a sudden to do as well as the other, that you have had
in use so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Emir was content to wait; meantime, the doctor made off with
his fair prize, whom he conducted safely back to Spain, and restored
her faithfully to her friends and her liberty. <span class=

<h2 class="main">YUSSUF&rsquo;S FRIEND.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The merchant Yussuf took great pains to train up his
only son in prudence, that he might be able, when he was no more, to
carry on his business, as he had done before him, with credit and
success. But in spite of all his lessons, he would be continually
putting his confidence in worthless persons; and in particular he
fostered an intimacy with a young Jew of dangerous character, who had
several times, by fraud and cunning, cheated him out of large sums, all
the while leading young Yussuf to believe that what he had done was
fair and just; nor would he listen to his father&rsquo;s suspicion of
him.</p>
<p>The merchant Yussuf had to take a journey to Africa with his son;
and while preparing for it, he lamented loudly over the difficulty he
was in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>as to placing his money in safety during his
absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you had not been so suspicious of my friend the
Jew,&rdquo; said young Yussuf, &ldquo;<i>there&rsquo;s</i> a man who
would have taken care of it for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my opinion of him,&rdquo; replied his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;re so suspicious,&rdquo; replied young Yussuf,
&ldquo;<i>I</i> know him better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you think so well of him, I will on your advice ask
him to take care of a strong-box for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, father!&rdquo; replied the young man;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll see you&rsquo;ll never repent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same evening, the merchant Yussuf sent a large chest, heavy
enough to contain a vast amount of treasure, to the Jew, by the hand of
his son; and the next day they set out for Africa.</p>
<p>Having brought their affairs to a prosperous termination, the two
Yussufs returned home to Granada.</p>
<p>On the morrow of their arrival, the merchant sent his son to the
Jew, to reclaim the strong-box. Young Yussuf returned presently, full
of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you have insulted my friend beyond all possibility of
reconciliation. He tells me it was not money you entrusted to his
keeping, but a parcel of broken stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; replied his father, &ldquo;how did your
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>honourable friend discover what was in my
strong-box? To find this out, he must have broken my locks; which will,
I think, show you it was very well I gave no greater value into
<i>his</i> keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Yussuf hung his head, and suffered himself to be guided after
that by his father&rsquo;s experience in his judgment of mankind.

<h2 class="main">THE SULTANA&rsquo;S PERFUMER-IN-CHIEF.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of all the luxurious appointments of the Moorish
houses, none were more prominent than the baths. And you must not think
that means a bath just big enough to get into, like those in our
houses. At Seville and Granada, and wherever the Moors lived and built,
you may see remains of the vast constructions which served them for
baths, all of white marble, and situated in the midst of scented shrubs
and sweet and brilliant flowers.</p>
<p>In their own hotter country, their baths received a still greater
development. There was once a sultana, Moorka-Hama, who had a fancy to
have <i>her</i> baths always filled with rose-water. One day, when she
came to bathe, she found the air perfumed to a most unusual degree; and
on her causing an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336"
name="pb336">336</a>]</span>inquiry into it, they found that the heat
of the sun had expressed the essential oil, which was floating on the
surface. The process thus suggested by accident, was immediately
imitated by art; and by it is produced the delicious scent which is now
an article of commerce, and which we call attar of roses. <span class=

href="#xd21e5341" name="xd21e5341src">1</a>.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Just as it was permitted to the heathen soothsayer
Balaam to foretell true things to the Lord&rsquo;s people, so it is
narrated that, a little before the taking of Granada by the Christians,
great consternation was produced among the infidel population by the
predictions of a Moorish dervish who was held in great veneration.</p>
<p>He was an ancient man, more than a hundred years old; his long white
beard seemed to be falling snow, it was more than a yard long, and he
could gird it round his waist. He lived out on the mountains of Granada
a life of great austerity; though it was long since he had never a hair
left, he wore no covering on his head, and the action of the sun and
rain had worn it into the appearance of a skull; his eyebrows grew long
and bushy, and served as a protection to his eyes; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>and
no clothing wore he but a tunic of camel&rsquo;s hide; his feet, too,
were bare, and his skin was yellow and shrivelled by long exposure. He
slept in a cave upon the cold ground, with a stone for his pillow. And
for all the hundred years of his life, he had never taken but one meal
a day, nor tasted aught but honey and milk, which other Moors brought
him by orders of the king.</p>
<p>All looked up to him as to a saint, in all Andalusia; and whatever
words he uttered, they respected it as Al Kor&aacute;n, and next to the
words of Mahomet himself.</p>
<p>One day, when the king and many people were gathered together to
hear him, he spoke to them these words: &ldquo;When you shall see
joined together Aragon and Castille, then know for certain that Granada
shall be taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the king who shall take it, know that his name shall
begin with F., for in his time faith<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5358src" href="#xd21e5358" name="xd21e5358src">2</a> shall reign
throughout his kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the queen his wife, her name will begin with Y., which
may be taken to stand for <i lang="es">ygual</i>; for his equal she
shall be, in courage and prudence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two shall likewise turn Judaism out of Spain, and set
up the Inquisition, by which the wicked shall be sentenced to death.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall acquire three kingdoms, and conquer the
Indies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they shall have a grandson, who shall be called Emperor
of Germany, also King of Hungary, who shall lay siege to the city of
the Pope, and lay low the three lilies of France in the field of
Pavia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the three laws now prevailing in Spain, one only shall
remain, and that shall be that one which commences with the font and
blessed water, and ends with blessed oils<a class="noteref" id=

<p>&ldquo;And thus they will make an end of the sect of Mahomet; for it
had but a thousand years given it, and as more than eight hundred are
past, it will soon now come to its end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is said to have been pronounced about fifty years before its
fulfilment, in the persons of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of
Castille. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=

<h2 class="main">HERNAN CORTES IN SANCTUARY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hernan Cortes was a Spanish gentleman whose
achievements in the new world earned him a fame almost as great and
almost as fantastic as that of any of the medi&aelig;val heroes. He was
first taken out to the West Indies as secretary to Diego Velasquez,
Governor of Cuba, whose arbitrary acts excited so much discontent, that
a commission of inquiry was sent out from Spain, which established its
head-quarters at Hispaniola<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5398src" href=
"#xd21e5398" name="xd21e5398src">1</a>. It was a perilous enterprise to
carry the complaint of Cuba over to the commission; and as no one could
be found to undertake the service, Hernan Cortes resolved to go
himself, though he had to cross the straits in an open boat. The
governor had been on the watch, and one of the swiftest boats under his
orders succeeded in overtaking Cortes&rsquo;s boat, and putting him in
irons to bring him back to shore. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341"
href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hernan Cortes was one of the handsomest of men; and his beauty and
misfortunes exciting the sympathy of his keepers, he was not very
vigilantly watched. Possessing great natural pluck and dexterity, he
managed in the night, as they neared the land, to slip his chains and
gain the shore. Here he hid himself in the jungle till daybreak, when
he found sanctuary in a little church. For several days he remained
here in safety, but among the frequenters of the shrine was Melinda
Xuares, whose piety, and modest demeanour in spite of her exceeding
beauty, attracted his attention and won his heart. Her brother, Juan
Xuares, with whom she lived, for she was an orphan, was delighted to
cultivate the acquaintance of a man he admired so much, and therefore
received him cordially.</p>
<p>In his remote retreat he thought himself so safe that he ventured
daily to spend some hours at Juan Xuares&rsquo; house; but the
governor&rsquo;s spies were down upon him. They caught him one day
outside the limits of the sanctuary, and clapped him in prison.</p>
<p>When he had been seized before, it was by an arbitrary stretch of
power: now there was a formal charge against him, for having broken
prison; and he was liable to be hanged.</p>
<p>Melinda&rsquo;s grief was indescribable: but she was brave as
beautiful; she no sooner heard of Hernan&rsquo;s imprisonment than she
hastened to the governor, and so successfully pleaded her lover&rsquo;s
cause, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>he ordered him to be set free and restored to
her.</p>
<p>Thus a noble life was spared; and Hernan Cortes afterwards became
the conqueror of Mexico. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href=

<h2 class="main">ARAUCANIA THE INDOMITABLE.</h2>
<h2 class="label">I.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the many traditions of Spanish adventures in the
West Indies and Americas, none are more interesting than those
concerning Araucania. Araucania is a province of Chili, which was
inhabited by the bravest and noblest tribe of aborigines. Their courage
and patriotism preserved them from ever succumbing to the invaders.
When the rule of Spain was at length effected, it was through the
conversion of the natives and their voluntary acceptance of a Christian
government&mdash;never by their subjugation; so much so, that for years
it was commonly known by the name of &ldquo;<span lang="es">El Estado
indomito</span>&rdquo; (the unconquered province).</p>
<p>Various stories are told of heroism on both sides which deserve a
place beside the noblest and most celebrated deeds of any history. Don
Alonso de Ercilla y Zu&ntilde;iga was a page in attendance on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>Philip II. at the Court of our Queen Mary, when
news came of a fresh outbreak of the indomitable Araucanians. Though a
mere lad, he pleaded for permission to join the expedition which was
immediately formed to quell the insurrection. He presents a marked
instance of the best type of Spanish character&mdash;brave and
patriotic, and at the same time chivalrous and generous. The intervals
of leisure he could snatch from the business of the campaign were spent
in recording in a heroic poem (which he wrote on any scraps of paper he
could procure, and when these failed on dried skins of animals) the
incidents of the war which struck his poetic fancy. Far from
attributing all the merit to those of his own side with the spirit of a
partisan, he has left a series of most touching pictures of the
nobleness and bravery of his antagonists. His poem begins, after the
manner of the Iliad, with a list of all the valiant chiefs, detailing
their qualities and the numbers they commanded. Then it goes on to give
a stirring description of their meeting to excite each other to rise in
the defence of their country. There was no hanging back or cowardly
fear, every one was anxious to be foremost to the fray. When they had
well eaten, and warmed their courage with deep potations from their
<i lang="es">tinajas</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e5431src" href=
"#xd21e5431" name="xd21e5431src">1</a> of wine, up rose Tuc&aacute;pel
the audacious, and declared he was ready to head the expedition. The
universe knew he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345"
name="pb345">345</a>]</span>was the bravest of them all; and if any one
disputed the boast, he was ready there and then to make it good. Not
suffering him to conclude his speech, Elicura broke in full of
boldness, &ldquo;To <i>me</i> it is given to lead the affair; and if
any one dispute the claim, he must taste the point of my
lance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <i>my</i> arm! to <i>my</i> arm,&rdquo; cried Ongolmo,
&ldquo;it behoves to brandish the iron club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folly!&rdquo; shouted Lincoya, mad with rage. &ldquo;It is
mine to be lord of the world, as certainly as my hand holds the oaken
staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None surely,&rdquo; interposed Argol, &ldquo;is so vain as to
put his prowess on a par with <i>mine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Cayocupil, shaking his heavy spear, cleared a free space around
him, and roared, &ldquo;Who will dispute <i>my</i> right to be first?
Let him come on, come on! I can match you, one or all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept the challenge!&rdquo; responded Lemolemo, darting
towards him, &ldquo;it is no effort to me to prove what is already mine
of right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Puren<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5463src" href="#xd21e5463"
name="xd21e5463src">2</a>, who was drinking at a distance, here dashed
furiously through the crowd, and proudly asked who dared harbour so
insane a thought; declaring that where Puren stood no one else could
bear command. When the storm was at its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb346" href="#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span>highest, all shouting
and shaking their spears, the venerable Col&oacute;colo, the most
ancient of all the caciques, came forward, and silence was made before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caciques, defenders of the State!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no
desire of command animates me; already by my great age I half belong to
the other world; my love of you all alone impels me to give you the
counsel of the white-haired. But spend not against one another the
courage which is needed against our common foe; fight not as to which
of you is most valiant, for you are all equal in prowess as in birth
and possessions, and any one of you is worthy to govern the world. But
as to which shall lead in this present expedition, be advised by me:
there must be one, and let the choice be decided by a trial of
endurance. Whichever of you shall longest support a baulk of timber of
exceeding weight without wearying, <i>he</i> shall take the
lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke, and not one voice was raised against the voice of the
ancient. So the baulk of timber was brought&mdash;a vast trunk of ebony
which a man could scarcely clasp round with his arms. Paycabi came
forward to make the essay, and planted it on his broad shoulders; six
hours he bore it with a steady strain, but he could not complete the
seventh. Cayocupil with an agile step walked up to the beam, and bore
it five hours; Gualemo, a well-grown youth, tried it after him, but
could not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347</a>]</span>endure it so long; Argol took it next, but gave
way at the sixth hour, and Ongolmo only kept it half an hour more.
Puren after him bore it half a day; Lebopia, four hours and a half.
Elicura stood up under it manfully longer than any, but at the ninth
hour he gave in. Tuc&aacute;pel supported it fourteen hours, and went
round to all the caciques boasting of the feat; which, when Lincoya
perceived, he tore the cloak from his terrible shoulders, and raising
the ponderous bulk without the least apparent strain, planted it on his
back curved ready to receive it. Then he ran hither and thither to show
how slight was the effort to him. He took it up at the rising sun, and
he bore it till the sun had returned to his rest, and through the dread
night Diana kept watch with him; and the sun rose again upon his
labours, yet he laid it not down till mid-day. And all the people were
astonished to find there was one so powerful among them, and they began
already to attribute to him the honours of the generalship.</p>
<p>Then Caup&oacute;lican came up to take his turn quietly and
alone&mdash;from his birth one of his eyes had been deprived of light;
but what was wanting in his power of vision was made up to him in his
surpassing strength.</p>
<p>He was a noble fellow, comely and strong, dignified in his bearing
and made for command, upright and unflinching, and a strict maintainer
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>that which is right. His form was muscular,
lithe and agile, deep-chested and erect. With the ready confidence of
assured superiority, he lifted the wood as if it had been a straw, and
poised it gracefully on his shoulders. And all the people praised the
movement with a shout of admiration; then Lincoya quailed, for he began
to fear the victory would be taken from him. But how much more, when
the hours passed by and the hero gave no sign of weariness: he paced up
and down, conquering fatigue by resistance, and increasing his power by
the habit of endurance. Thus through two days and two nights he never
flinched, and then, as if because he had done enough&mdash;not because
he was exhausted, he lifted down the weight and flung it from him to a
mighty distance, showing his strength still unimpaired.</p>
<p>Then all the people shouted and said Caup&oacute;lican was their
leader, and the fear of him was so great, that even those at a distance
obeyed his word as if he had been present. Caup&oacute;lican first
exerted his command in setting order among his ranks, and assigning a
place to each cacique and his followers. Then he made out a sagacious
plan of attack on the Spaniards, and stirred up the brave Araucanians
to the contest by assuring them of a speedy victory. Some advised this,
and some that, but Caup&oacute;lican, with his serene word of command,
reduced all to willing obedience. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349"
href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Spaniards had set up three forts to strengthen their hold on the
territory, and against the most formidable of these the first attack
was directed. The rising being quite unsuspected, the natives
approached the fort easily; but when the Spaniards saw the horde
approaching, they quickly raised the cry to arms, and sallied out to
meet them with supercilious impetuosity. They soon found, however, they
had no mean foes to deal with; though weary and footsore with their
hasty march, the Araucanians no sooner came in presence of the foe,
than they fought with all the pride and confidence of assured victory.
Resistance met resistance, for hours neither side wavered, till at last
the Spaniards were glad to secure their retreat in good order into the
fort.</p>
<p>Now there was in the Spanish army a brave youth, who, seeing his
countrymen give way before the barbarians, was moved to indignation;
and when the gate of the fort had closed on the last of them, he stood
alone<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5494src" href="#xd21e5494" name=
"xd21e5494src">3</a> on the drawbridge, and cried to the insurgents,
&ldquo;Come on! come on, the most valiant of you! One at a time, I will
match thirty of you&mdash;nay I refuse not to a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than a hundred Araucanians ran hotly to the encounter; but
undismayed, that Spanish youth stood boldly on the bridge, and yet he
called to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>them to come on. Firm and erect he met them, and
with a well-placed stroke of his trusty sword laid one and again
another and another on the ground. His comrades, watching the unequal
contest, sallied through a postern of the fort, and made a diversion
for his relief. Many such devoted deeds were done on both sides that
day; but it was vain the Spaniards fought like lions, for on and on the
Araucanians poured, and for every Spaniard they were twenty. Then, when
it was useless to resist longer against their overpowering numbers,
they agreed during the night-time to abandon the fort; and trusting to
the swiftness of their steeds, they rode away to a place of greater
safety. So Caup&oacute;lican and his caciques with great rejoicing took
possession of the place, and laid the fort even with the ground.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It happened once, after there had been a desperate
encounter between the Spaniards and Araucanians, that Don Alonso de
Ercilla went out late at night to meditate on the lessons of the
battle-field strewn with the bodies of those who had been well and
brave but a few hours before. The night was dark and gloomy, and yet he
thought he discerned indistinctly a form moving from place to place,
quietly and noiselessly as a spirit might move; and anon there came
from it sighs and groans dismal to hear. Bending down, and hiding
himself in the long grass, he tracked the figure, not without some fear
at heart; but clasping his trusty sword, he came swiftly upon it. Then
it rose erect, and addressed him in humble, timorous accents:
&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, Se&ntilde;or, have pity on me; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>I am
but a woman, and never have I offended you! If my misery does not move
you to spare me, at least consider that there is no glory to be gained
by killing a woman&mdash;or rather, slay me, but first let me fulfil my
work.&rdquo; Then Don Ercilla asked her what it was had brought her
there. And she in dolorous tones answered, &ldquo;Never was grief like
mine; I loved him with true love and purest constancy, and to-day he
was taken from me, and slain. Let me but seek the body of him who was
my soul, and let me lay it in a decent grave, and <i>then</i> take my
life, lay my body beside his, for so great is my grief that I dread
living without him more than lying beside him in death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ercilla was greatly moved by her sorrow, but still he had his
duty as a soldier to consider; she might have come to spy the situation
of the Spanish camp, under the idea that, as a woman, she would be less
easily suspected; and her grief might be assumed in order to induce him
to release her. Yet his compassion swayed him at last, so he let her
live, and moreover assisted her in her search, leading her to relieve
her oppressed heart by pouring out all her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for no relief is possible
for me, no rest till death. He is gone, and if I open now the old
wounds by thinking of him, it is but in the hope that in the violent
effort I may sink and die. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Know then, that I am Tegualda, daughter of the Cacique
Brancol. Vain of the attentions that were paid me through many young
years, I refused to listen to the suits of any of the young Caciques
whom my father presented to me; nor when they danced or wrestled before
me would I regard them with favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day my father took me to the shady thicket where gentle
Gualebo pours its limpid stream into the floods of broad Itata with a
soothing murmur, and where the sunlight playing through the thick
foliage of the breeze-shaken trees, diapered the perfumed air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely had we sat down, when there entered on the plain
that spread away before us a band of youths, earnest and silent. At a
sign from Brancol various games began, in which each exerted himself to
the utmost only to win a glance from me. To me, however, it was a
greater pleasure to stand detached from them all, and while they ran,
and fought, and showed strange feats of endurance, rather than gratify
them by a look, to rest my eyes on the murmuring stream, watching the
polished stones, now bathed in snow-like foam, now piercing, black and
stark through the mimic waves; or on the waving trees, flinging their
lithesome limbs in every graceful attitude, now wide apart, now
interlaced in one another&rsquo;s thrall; or on the far-off sky,
sparkling and peering through the leafy shade; on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>any
thing rather than on the contending youths; and thus I sat there,
disdaining all interest in the games, and, as I deemed, fancy-free,
when all at once a loud cry rose from the contending throng: this was
no unusual occurrence, but it was so exulting and prolonged that I
could not choose but ask the cause. The youth who stood nearest me made
answer, &lsquo;Did you not observe, Se&ntilde;ora, how the brave
Mareguano has won the victory over every other combatant? and now when,
with joyous haste, we were leading him to receive the conqueror&rsquo;s
wreath from your hand, to gird his temples in token that he is the
first and bravest of our company&mdash;all at once that handsome lad
yonder, wearing green and scarlet for his device, suddenly confronted
him, and at their first contest laid him low on the green sward.
Mareguano no sooner regained his feet than he required to be allowed
another trial; but as this is against all our rules, it was refused
him. So the stranger youth comes to be crowned by you, unless you,
whose power is absolute over us, suffer them to renew the
contest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he spoke the shouting crowd led him up to me; but before I
could take the wreath to crown him, he placed himself modestly before
me on his knees, and thus spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lady, I seek one favour, though I be a stranger, and
have no claim to your regard, yet I have the boldness to prefer my
request, having no greater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href=
"#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>desire than to live and die in
your service. Let me then have your permission to try another fall with
Mareguano; ay, and <i>another</i> and <i>another</i>, even to a
hundred, till he is satisfied of my superiority; for here striving in
your presence, I know I am certain to come off with greater and greater
glory in every trial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, who cared little about the matter, carelessly granted
what he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the instant the two darted off to meet each other: then
came a prolonged struggle, fought out with desperate resolve; now
lithely bending, now strained to their utmost height, they wrestled for
a long space, grasping each other in such iron fashion that it would
seem they scarce could breathe; at last the stranger youth ended the
contest by seizing Mareguano round the body, then lifting him high in
the air, and flinging him headlong on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sooner had he accomplished the feat than the assembled
people, delighted at this exhibition of manly strength, bore him along
in triumph to receive his reward at my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I looked at him, kneeling before me again, flushed with
success, praised and applauded by all around, yet waiting for my word,
as if he prized it more than all the rest, I felt a new emotion take
possession of me, I perceived an interest in him which I had never
experienced for any of the others, and it was with difficulty I could
command <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>myself sufficiently to conceal what I felt.
However, I rose with all the dignity I could summon, placed the crown
on his brow, and announced that the prize I held for the next contest
was a ring ornamented with a fine emerald, and that it was for the
winner in the race immediately to follow. I could not help saying it in
such a way as to betray I expected it would be on <i>him</i> I should
have to confer it. Nor was I mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The competitors, forty in number, were ranged in a long row,
panting with anxiety to start. The signal scarcely given, the whole
forty set off as one man, and so swiftly that their feet scarcely
seemed to touch the sand; but Crepino (such was the name of the young
stranger) pursued the sport with so much ardour that he distanced the
very wind, and touched the red <i lang="es">Palio</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5559src" href="#xd21e5559" name="xd21e5559src">1</a> before
the others were near it. But I, when he was brought back to me, was
more troubled than before; so that when I handed him the ring, I gave
him as it were my liberty enclosed in it. And he no sooner had received
the ring than, holding it still before me, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="es">Se&ntilde;ora</i>, I pray you accept it
of me; for though it be but little to offer to you, yet it is offered
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>entire devotion, and the favour you will confer
on me in accepting it will be so great, that it will make me rich, and
shall so strengthen and animate me, that there will thenceforth be no
undertaking so arduous that I shall not be able to accomplish it; and
so you will have added the bravest heart and the stoutest arm to the
Araucanian band.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not but accept what was so gracefully proffered; and
now, the games being concluded, the meeting was broken up, and I had to
return home with my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For three weeks I concealed what I felt, that I might not
appear to change too suddenly from what had been a life-long resolve.
But I could not overcome the desire to see him again. When next my
father, therefore, urged me to make my choice among the young Caciques,
I told him that I had resolved to attend to his bidding, and that my
choice had fallen on Crepino, who was of honourable name, brave,
well-mannered, and well-grown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was all rejoiced at this announcement, and, kissing
me on the forehead, he confirmed my choice; he told me how on Crepino
of all the others his own heart yearned, and how Crepino himself had
sued for me, and yet had urged him in no way to overrule my will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With joyful haste the nuptial ceremonies were performed over
us, and all was mirth and gladness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>That was but one
short month ago, and to-day your people have slain him who was all my
joy; and all our hopes of happiness are poured out like water on the
ground. What comfort is there for so great misery! There is nothing
left to hope for now, since earth contains no good which could be
measured against such a grief!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, therefore, let me seek my lord, and bury him; for it is
not meet that his dear body should fall a prey to voracious beasts and
birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Ercilla was so much moved by her recital that he no longer
doubted her, but helped her to search for Crepino&rsquo;s body. When
the morning dawned they found it, stark and cold, and disfigured by a
cannon-ball. Tegualda&rsquo;s agony revived when she came in sight of
his shattered form. She threw herself on him, placed her heart on his
heart, and her lips on his, that so she might perchance yet call back
the life; and then she struck her face, and tore her long dark hair,
and pressed her fingers tightly round her throat, and threw herself
again upon the ground, not knowing what she did for very grief. Don
Ercilla looked on compassionating, knowing it was but distressing her
to interfere till the first violence of her agony was past. Then, at
peril of treachery towards him, alone in their midst, he bade her make
a signal to call her people, and ordered them to bear away
Crepino&rsquo;s body in decent order. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then he composed her mantle round her, and, supporting her, gently
led her along behind it till they reached the <i lang="es">sierra</i>
where her own people dwelt, and then he delivered her over to her
father&rsquo;s keeping. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href=

<h2 class="label">III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">FITON&rsquo;S CAVE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the course of the war an exploring party of
Spaniards had been sent to bring a report of the chances of success to
an expedition for recovering the coast-line of the Araucanian province.
Time passed on, and the party failing to return, great anxiety was felt
as to their fate by the Christians; at last some of the bravest
volunteered to go and look after them in various directions, and as
great caution was necessary, it was agreed the volunteers should go out
separately, travelling by night, and keeping themselves concealed by
day. It was a perilous enterprize, and Don Alonzo de Ercilla, who was
always foremost at any brave deed, was the first to offer himself; and
he gives us the following account of an adventure that befell him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span></p>
<p>He was making his way through a wild brake, helped by the scanty
light of the moon, when he found himself on the edge of a steep descent
leading to a vast plain; a narrow path cut the steep, down which a
tall, lank native of great age was threading his way. His back was
bowed, he was so feeble that he trembled as he walked, and his legs
were so fleshless that they looked like dry roots of trees. Don Ercilla
advanced to offer his assistance down the rugged descent, and thought
at the same time to gather some information of his missing friends, or
as to the best means of tracing them. No sooner, however, was the old
man conscious of his approach, than, darting into another path at a
sharp angle with the first, he turned and fled up the steep side faster
than a hunted deer. Don Ercilla spurred his horse, and thought to
overtake him easily, but in a moment he was out of sight, neither was
it possible for a stranger to find his way so as to proceed with any
rapidity over the overgrown crag. Giving up the pursuit, he came at
last to the bottom of the declivity, where the stream Rauco flowed
turbulently, its course being closed in by sharp rocks on both sides;
but a little way down it, on the near bank, was a grove of shady trees,
and under them an antelope grazing. The sight reminded him he had once
dreamt that this meeting an antelope should be a sign of something
important to befall <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362"
name="pb362">362</a>]</span>him, so, rejoicing at the incident, he made
his way up to the gentle beast.</p>
<p>The antelope had been feeding undisturbed by the sound of the
rushing torrent, but no sooner became conscious of a man&rsquo;s
presence than, leaving the verdant pasture, she struck wildly into a
steep and narrow path, dashing through briar and jungle and close-grown
trees; wherever she led, however, Don Ercilla followed, though he had
need to spur his horse hard to keep up with her. At last she brought
him in sight of a poor little hut, piled up at the foot of an ancient
oak. At the sound of their hasty steps an old man came out, to whom,
panting, the antelope approached as for protection. The old man
tenderly stroked her reeking sides, and then, addressing Don Ercilla,
asked him what fate or misadventure had brought him to his remote
retreat, which strangers&rsquo; steps had never yet found out.
&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have had the misfortune to get
separated from your company, you will find welcome here, and all that
my humble roof can offer to restore strength; and fear nothing from
your enemies while you are under my protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding him so affable and pleasant, Don Ercilla gave him his
confidence, and not only told him his errand, but also opened to him a
wish he had long harboured of visiting the cave of Fiton, the great
Araucanian Wizard. The kind old man, without waiting so much as to
answer him, took <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363"
name="pb363">363</a>]</span>his hand, and at once leaving his seat set
out to lead him. It was the season of early summer, and, as the sun was
by this time well risen, they picked their way through the shadiest
paths. As they went along, the old man spoke thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lands were in Araucania. I am called Guaticolo the
Unhappy, who, in my robust years, was a valiant fighting man, and in
office predecessor to Col&oacute;colo. Seven several times have I led
our people on to victory on the battle-field, and a thousand times have
my now hairless temples been girt with the tokens of success. But as in
this life no state is permanent, so fortune was inconstant to me also.
After success came defeat; after honour, shame. At Aynavillo I had the
misfortune to be loser in a wagered contest, on which my position had
been set. Finding myself burdened with a dishonoured life, I could
devise no better end to it than to bury myself in this retreat, where,
for twenty years, no mortal foot has tracked me; and by strange help it
is, I ween, that you have been brought so far; who am I, therefore, to
resist the direction you have received from above? How intractable
soever Fiton may be, I will urge the claims of relationship, as he is
my uncle, and thus induce him to admit you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dwells in the heart of a bleak mountain where the glad sun
never penetrates, and whence the foot of man is shut out. But his
wisdom and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>power are so great that he can by his one word
perform any of nature&rsquo;s operations. In the blazing heat and
dazzling light of noonday he can cover the heavens with the darkness of
night. When the sky is one even blue, without assistance of wind or
clouds, he can draw rain from a barren heaven. He can arrest the course
of the bounding rivers, and of the birds in the midst of their flight.
The burnt-up grasses of August at his word raise their withered blades,
and resume their verdant hues; the tides of the sea obey his voice, and
forget the commands of the moon. And, much more than all this, he can
tell the destinies of men, and foresee the fate of nations. It would be
impossible for words of mine to overstate his mighty and irresistible
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he had been speaking they had passed through a long tract of
forest, where the trees grew so thickly, and were so encumbered with
brushwood, that Don Ercilla was obliged to tie his horse up and proceed
on foot. At last they reached a low opening in a rock, through which
was a long dark passage, where they could hardly walk upright, and at
the end of it a door garnished all round with heads of wild beasts.
Guaticolo opened the door, and led Don Ercilla by the hand into a
spacious vault, in the centre of which burnt a strange and perpetual
light; in the walls of the cave were cut many stone shelves, on which
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>ranged jars of ointments, essences, and herbs.
There were preserved the far-piercing eyes of the lynx and that of the
venomous basilisk; red gore of angry men, and foam from the mouth of
rabid dogs; parts of the wing of the harpy, the venom of the
amphisbena, and the tail of the treacherous asp, which gives death
wrapt up in a pleasant dream; mould off a truncated head unworthy of
burial, and the tongue of the horrid hemorreo, whose puncture can never
be staunched, but whosoever it wounds must bleed to death. In a huge
transparent vase was a griffin&rsquo;s heart, pierced through with an
arrow, and the ashes of an eastern phoenix. Stings of serpents, and
tails of scorpions, and whatsoever is deadly and venomous in
nature.</p>
<p>While Don Ercilla was engaged in examining this strange repertory, a
hidden door gave entrance to a lean old man, whom he at once recognized
for him who had run away from him with such exceeding rapidity, who
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no little boldness in you, so young, to have dared to
come thus unbidden to my presence, and to pursue me in my occult
habitation, where it is not permitted to foot of man to tread;
nevertheless, as I know all things, I know that in your heart you mean
no harm, therefore I allow you to live, and will now listen to your
intent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Guaticolo took upon himself to explain his errand for him in a
long speech, in which he commenced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366"
href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>by lauding the wizard&rsquo;s
influence, then detailed Don Ercilla&rsquo;s fame, and finally told him
of his dream, in which he had learnt that he might gain from Fiton
supernatural information of the fate of the contest in which his
Spanish brethren in arms were at the time engaged with the Turks in
Europe.</p>
<p>Fiton, in great good humour with Guaticolo&rsquo;s
dexterously-administered flattery, took Don Ercilla by the hand, and
led him through the secret door by which he had himself entered. It
opened into a very different apartment from the other. No mortal tongue
could describe its beauty and costliness; the floor was paved with
crystal tiles all lustrous with cunning radiance, while the roof was
studded with brilliant stones, so that the whole place sparkled with
dazzling splendour. Supported on pillars of shining gold a hundred
statues of heroes were ranged round the room, so life-like in design
that a deaf man might have thought they spoke. On the broad medallions
behind were pictured forth the valiant deeds of each, displaying the
designer&rsquo;s acquaintance with the history of all nations.</p>
<p>In the midst of the spacious hall, which measured half a mile every
way, swung a globe of light, balanced in the air by supernatural
power.</p>
<p>When Don Ercilla had spent some time examining all these wonders,
Fiton came to him, and, with his wand pointing to the globe of light,
explained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>to him that it contained an epitome of the
world, and had cost him forty years of labour; but contained the
representation of all that was happening, or ever would happen, in any
part or time of the world. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as it
seems you are a poet, whose business it is to chronicle the great deeds
of the fighting men of your country, and you have already celebrated
their achievements by land, I will now show you what they are doing at
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he touched the bright globe with his wand, and Don Ercilla saw
it represented the world with all its parts delineated, and all the
people on it seen as clearly as he might have seen his own face in a
mirror.</p>
<p>Then Fiton pointed to the Mediterranean sea, and conducted his eyes
to that part of it which washes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5644src"
href="#xd21e5644" name="xd21e5644src">1</a> the Ausonian shore, and he
saw it was all covered with galleys bearing the devices of the Pope,
and Philip II., and the Venetian Republic; and from the port of Lepanto
there came out to meet them the galleys of the Crescent. Then with a
hoarse and terrible voice, Fiton invoked the infernal powers, crying,
&ldquo;O terrible Can-Cerberus, Charon, weary boatman, yellow Orcus,
and irresistible Pluto! O chilly Styx, O lake Avernus, O seething
waters of Acheron, Lethe, Cocytus, and ruddy Phlegethon! O Furies who
with relentless cruelty torment the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span>souls of the lost,
and Gorgons, whose hair of wriggling snakes the shades tremble as they
behold! compelled by my all-powerful word, afford to this earth-born
youth a clear vision of the work now accomplishing in the waters of
Lepanto.&rdquo; As he spoke he frantically waved his wand.</p>
<p>Then behold, the waters of the sea boiled over, and the sterile
north-east wind rounding the white sails, the rival fleets were tossed
in sudden motion, the gallant Spanish vessels bearing down proudly on
the Pagan galleys. Mighty warriors were there, whose names and deeds of
fame were borne in characters of flame around their brows; many, whom
he had known as companions of his own in childhood, now bronzed with
the hardships of many a bold campaign. Suddenly the signal of the fight
resounded, and then the Christian hosts, following the sign of their
redemption, poured down with resistless ardour on their Pagan foes.
With breathless interest Don Ercilla watched the fortunes of his
friends, shouted to them&mdash;so present was <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5651" title="Source: the the">the</span> scene&mdash;to bear them
bravely, nor waver in their courage. For hours the fight raged, and
many a brave servant of Christ fell deadly wounded into the deep waves,
and tinged the blue waters with his generous blood. Don Ercilla wept
and exulted by turns, as, one after another, he saw dear friends lost
to him for ever in this life, and yet the Christian arms prevailing
inch by inch, till at last, successful and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>triumphant, they swept the encroaching Turk from
the face of the sea, inflicting an irreparable wound on his power, and
setting a bound to his aggressions which he might not pass.

<h2 class="main">MATANZAS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Matanzas is at the present day one of the most
populous and important towns of the island of Cuba: second to Havannah,
it goes on ever increasing in commercial activity; it has a railroad
and a well-sheltered harbour, and is surrounded by an extent of sugar
and coffee cultivation which promises, with a never-failing supply of
exports, to maintain and constantly increase its prosperity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Matanzas has an ugly name; for, though euphonious
enough to our ears, its meaning is neither more nor less than
&ldquo;Slaughterings,&rdquo; and the ugly name is connected with an
ugly history, and, it would seem, an inseparable association of
ugliness in every detail. Its situation is flat and unpicturesque; the
buildings&mdash;unlike, and indeed in strong contrast with the
beautiful outlines which, imitating those prevalent in Spain at the
time of her greatest colonial eminence, were spread by her all over the
new world&mdash;are mean and bare, and, while <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>too
solidly built of stone to offer any hope that the venerable-making hand
of time will ever clothe them with any even adventitious interest, they
are yet altogether deficient in a grand or imposing character.</p>
<p>The following story of the circumstances of its origin may be taken
to account for the absence of those softening influences of family life
and home traditions, which in the other colonies reproduced many of the
most beautiful features of the old country.</p>
<p>There once lived, in a village of Castille, a man who thought only
of enjoying himself, and who spent all his money without taking any
account of how much he had got left for the future; so that at last a
day came when he had nothing at all left, and not a bite of any thing
but his nails. When he came home without a <i lang="es">maravedi</i>,
his wife and children dinned him so for food that they drove him
distracted; and he borrowed a rope of a neighbour, and went to an
olive-tree to hang himself.</p>
<p>He had hardly fastened the rope to the tree, when a little sprite
appeared, sitting astride on one of its branches, who called out to
him, &ldquo;What are you going to do? You, a Christian, going to hang
yourself like Judas! Give up such an idea; here, take this purse, which
is never empty, and go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Perrico (that was the name of our man) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>caught at the purse to see if such good fortune
could be true, and drew out one <i lang="es">duro</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e5681src" href="#xd21e5681" name="xd21e5681src">1</a> after
another without stopping, like words out of a woman&rsquo;s mouth. When
he saw that the store was so bountiful, he untied the rope and coiled
it up, and made the best of his way home. But passing by the way a
tavern where he had been accustomed to take refreshment, he could not
resist the temptation of turning in; nor, when he was in, the
temptation of ordering the best drinks and viands, till at last he took
more than was good for him, and passed the night under the table,
drunk, and as insensible as the dead in the churchyard.</p>
<p>The host, who had observed that he payed for every thing he ordered,
<i lang="es">duro</i> after <i lang="es">duro</i> out of his little
purse, and that there was always a <i lang="es">duro</i> left,
determined to possess himself of the treasure, and so told his wife to
make another exactly like it, and then changed it against the magic
purse in Perrico&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>In the morning Perrico woke, and suspecting nothing, ran home to his
wife as joyous as a holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more hunger! no more misery!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s money enough to last our lives&mdash;here&rsquo;s
enough for every one; come, come all and be merry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he pulled out his purse, and flung the one <i lang=
"es">duro</i> in it on the table, but when he expected to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>find
another, it continued empty; then he turned it inside out, and threw it
up in the air, and flung it on the floor. But no more <i lang=
"es">duros</i> appeared. And his wife, thinking it all a trick, grew
more provoked than before, and rated him with an angrier voice than
ever.</p>
<p>Perrico, now quite desperate, took up his rope again, and returned
to his olive-tree. No sooner had he tied the rope to the branch than
the goblin appeared, and reproached him as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo; pleaded Perrico;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to find work,&rdquo; answered the goblin;
&ldquo;nevertheless I&rsquo;ll give you another chance. Take this
table-cloth, and with it you&rsquo;ll never want for a meal; for
whenever you spread it, you&rsquo;ll find a meal ready cooked, upon
it.&rdquo; So saying, he disappeared.</p>
<p>Perrico took the cloth, and spread it out in the shade of the
olive-tree, and immediately it was covered with dishes of choice food,
and wine, and fruits, and flowers; so he made the best meal he had ever
eaten in his life, folded his table-cloth, and started for home.</p>
<p>Meantime it had got late, and as he passed the tavern, the idea of a
comfortable bed seemed more inviting than a long walk, so he turned in
and went to bed.</p>
<p>The host, who had made such a fortunate prize out of him the day
before, suspected sagaciously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374"
href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>that he might have brought
some other wonderful gift along with him this time; so while he was
sound asleep he turned over his things, and finding the new
table-cloth, easily guessed this was what he was searching for, and so
replaced it with another like it, and carried Perrico&rsquo;s off.</p>
<p>In the morning Perrico woke, and, suspecting nothing, ran home to
his wife as joyous as a holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come wife, come children!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;no more
hunger! no more misery! here&rsquo;s food to last our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he spread the table-cloth out on the table; to his
chagrin, however, instead of eatables, it was only covered with ugly
patches.</p>
<p>Then followed an outcry such as never had been heard before; mother
and children set upon him without mercy, and glad enough he was to
escape from them, his rope safely tucked under his arm.</p>
<p>Once more he secured the rope, and once more the goblin appeared.
&ldquo;Christian!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;where is your
patience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All beaten out of me by my wife&rsquo;s blows,&rdquo; replied
Perrico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no excuse,&rdquo; said the sprite;
&ldquo;nevertheless I&rsquo;ll help you once more. Here&rsquo;s a stick
for you&mdash;take this, and when you&rsquo;re armed with it no one
will venture to interfere with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perrico caught at the stick, and walked home <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>with
as much importance as a beadle bearing his mace; and when the children
came clamouring round him, as they had seen their mother do, he only
said, &ldquo;At them! good stick!&rdquo; and the stick flew out of his
hand, and sent them all running helter-skelter. Then his wife came to
the defence of her children, and Perrico had only to say, &ldquo;At
her! good stick!&rdquo; and the stick soon disposed of her also.</p>
<p>But the neighbours, hearing her cries, sent for the Alcalde and his
Aguaciles, who prepared to take him; but Perrico cried once more,
&ldquo;At them! good stick!&rdquo; and straightway the stick sent them
all flying in every direction.</p>
<p>Then they sent an express messenger to the king, to tell him how his
officers were being treated, and he sent a regiment of grenadiers. But
Perrico had one remedy against all: &ldquo;At them! good stick!&rdquo;
he cried, and in a trice the stick belaboured away, leaving one with a
broken arm, another with his eye knocked out, the colonel sprawling in
the dust, and every musket or side-arm rendered totally unfit for use,
till the soldiers, thinking Lucifer had been let loose among them, were
glad to get away as fast as their legs would carry them.</p>
<p>So Perrico was left alone, and was glad to rest after all the
excitement, but took care when he went to sleep to hide his stick in
his breast, that it might not be taken from him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he woke in the morning he found his hands and feet manacled,
and an officer of justice standing over him, reading aloud the sentence
of death which had been passed upon him. Perrico said nothing, but as
soon as they loosened his bonds on the scaffold he took out his stick,
and crying, &ldquo;At them! good stick!&rdquo; soon delivered himself
of executioners, guards, gaolers, and all who stood in his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the fellow alone!&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;or all
my subjects will be killed&mdash;only let&rsquo;s get rid of
him.&rdquo; So to bribe him to go he promised him a large tract of land
in America, and shipped him off to the island of Cuba. Here he founded
a town; but his stick did so much execution on the inhabitants, that
people gave it the name of Matanzas.</p>
